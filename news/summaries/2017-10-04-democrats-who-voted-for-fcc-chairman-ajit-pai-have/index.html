          <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1264" data-orig-width="1968"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/393acc9bccc07905c0fff02c03f73f74/tumblr_inline_oxb6jw0mPA1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="1264" data-orig-width="1968"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, October 4, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>Joe Manchin (D-WV), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jon Tester (D-MT) are among the first Democrats to be listed as “Team Cable” on BattleForTheNet.com congressional score board</i></h2><p>The four Democratic Senators who ignored overwhelming public support for net neutrality protections and voted to reconfirm former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai as chairman of the FCC are among the first from their parties to be listed as part of “Team Cable” on a prominent <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard" target="_blank"><b>“Congressional Scorecard”</b></a> on net neutrality campaign site BattleForTheNet.com, run by Demand Progress, Free Press Action Fund, and Fight for the Future..</p><p>Fight for the Future also announced that they will target these lawmakers in their districts with <b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/nnbillboards/#page-1" target="_blank">crowdfunded</a> </b>billboards informing constituents of their Senator’s controversial vote. The group has previously targeted 9 members of Congress who have publicly supported Ajit Pai’s plan to slash Title II protections, but these four represent the first Democrats to be targeted as part of the crowdfunded campaign.</p><p><b>See a mockup of what the billboards will look like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hfsp5" target="_blank">here.</a></b></p><p>“Every member of Congress needs to understand that you can’t vote against the free and open Internet and get away with it,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,</b> “let this be a lesson to any lawmaker considering going against the interests of their constituents to support legislation or FCC action that undermines existing net neutrality rules.”</p><p>“The only interests Ajit Pai represents are those of the few gatekeeper media companies that want to charge people more for nothing and give them less of everything,” <b>said Candace Clement, Free Press Action Fund Campaign Director. </b>“Those in Congress who voted to confirm Ajit Pai did so against the demands and interests of their constituents. Pai stands against an open internet, online privacy, local control of local media and affordable access for everyone. Team Internet will continue to remind Congress that you can’t do harm to the people you represent without hearing from us every day and everywhere. You can’t sell out our rights in Washington without consequences.” </p><p>“By voting to confirm Ajit Pai, these senators fundamentally failed Americans who rely on, or are in need of an open and affordable internet,” <b>said Mark Stanley, Director of Operations for Demand Progress.</b> “A vote for Pai was a vote to end net neutrality protections. It was a vote for less affordable broadband service for those who need it most. And it was a vote for greater media consolidation, which will lead to higher costs and worse service for consumers. Pai’s vision for our country&rsquo;s communications networks is overwhelmingly unpopular among the public. Constituents are watching intently, and going forward it is incumbent on lawmakers from both parties to unequivocally oppose Pai and his policies that place the interests of Big Cable over those of ordinary Americans.”</p><p>Demand Progress, Free Press Action Fund, and Fight for the Future were the leading groups behind the massive July 12 net neutrality day of action, which drove a <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-13-update-historic-day-of-action-for-net-neutrality/" target="_blank"><b>record breaking</b></a> number of comments, calls, and emails, to the FCC and Congress.</p><p>###</p>
