<p><span><span><span><span><strong>WASHINGTON —</strong> Early <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975458772"><span class="aQJ">Tuesday</span></span>, the Federal Communications Commission&rsquo;s electronic filing system crashed under an extra-heavy load of public comments in response to the initial comment deadline on the agency&rsquo;s proposed Net Neutrality ruling. While the FCC has said it’s fixing the system, problems persist. In response, Net Neutrality advocates will head to the FCC in person this afternoon to hand-deliver hundreds of thousands of public comments.<br/><br/> Groups delivering their comments today include the ACLU, the Center for Media Justice, Common Cause, CREDO, DailyKos, Demand Progress, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Engine Advocacy, Fight for the Future, Free Press, MAGNet, MoveOn, the Media Mobilizing Project, Mozilla, OpenMedia International, Popular Resistance, reddit and Voices for Internet Freedom. Representatives will be available for comment and photos. They will also ask the FCC to explain how it plans to cope with the overload.<br/><br/><strong>WHAT: </strong>Hand-delivery of hundreds of thousands of public comments in support of Net Neutrality<br/><br/><strong>WHY: </strong>Earlier today the FCC’s electronic comment filing system faltered, unable to handle the crush of public comments being filed.<br/><br/><strong>WHO:</strong> The ACLU, the Center for Media Justice, Common Cause, CREDO, DailyKos, Demand Progress, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Engine Advocacy, Fight for the Future, Free Press, MAGNet, the Media Mobilizing Project, Mozilla, OpenMedia International, Popular Resistance, reddit and Voices for Internet Freedom<br/><br/><strong>WHERE:</strong> Outside the FCC’s headquarters at  445 12th St. SW, Washington, D.C. 20554<br/><br/><strong>WHEN: </strong><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975458773"><span class="aQJ">3:30 p.m. ET</span></span><br/></span></span></span></span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 10:54 EDT on July 14, 2014</span>


        <p><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8puriGMbq1ri3xd7.jpg?1512060081490"/></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-cfad6852-3551-9b67-cd1f-99c48481c3ed"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>There’s just thirty six hours left.  That’s how long we have to get pro-Net Neutrality comments submitted to the FCC in front of their first comment period deadline — and save the Internet from the clutches of Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner, and their ilk.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">The deadline is tomorrow! Click here to submit your comments to the FCC right now.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;re in a battle to for the Internet as we know it.</span><span> Net Neutrality guarantees all websites — start-ups, blogs, independent media, lolcats — an even playing field.  It’s essentially the First Amendment of the Internet. It’s what has made it so revolutionary, and it gives all of us a voice. </span></p>
<p><span>But the cable companies want to gut Net Neutrality to increase their profits. Without Net Neutrality, those corporations can kill websites by relegating them to slow lanes if they don’t pay fees — or if they just don’t like the content they contain. That threatens not only the Internet that we love, but the very foundations of a free society.</span></p>
<p><span>Cable companies are spending millions of lobbying dollars in an attempt to drown out the overwhelming cry of the public who are demanding that the FCC protect the Internet. Our best shot at winning this is to strike hard right now and flood the FCC with more comments than they’ve ever gotten before (even more than Janet Jackson.) </span><span>We are so close to that goal already that if everyone reading this takes action, we’ll hit it by the end of the day.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.org" target="_blank">We made submitting an official comment to the FCC as easy as signing a petition. Click here to speak up for net neutrality before the July 15th deadline!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Many of you have already signed petitions to the FCC  — and so have literally millions of others.  That’s incredible — and it’s had a huge impact. But the ISP monopolies are now we all need to go one step further and submit formal comments into the FCC’s Net Neutrality proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s really quick and easy, and carries way more weight than the usual petition signature does. You’ll be a formal part of the process.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Click here to submit a formal comment to the FCC before the end of this comment period — it’s over TOMORROW.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Just a few months ago, FCC was poised to undermine Net Neutrality all together.  Because we all pushed back, now they’re considering adopting rules that would save it, and protect the web for the long term.</span></p>
<p><strong>But they’ll only do so if we speak out again, even louder.  </strong></p>
<p><span>The cable companies have armies of lobbyists and public relations firms &ndash; and since they own so much of the communications infrastructure, it&rsquo;s especially easy for them to push their propaganda. </span></p>
<p><strong>But we have millions of people on our side — and our only chance of beating the cable companies is if we all take a stand, together.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Click here to visit our brand new website and send the FCC a formal comment demanding support for Net Neutrality.  It’ll only take a minute.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>With urgency and appreciation,<br/>The Fight for the Future team<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Evan, Kevin, Vasjen, Jessica, and Jeff</span><br/><br/><span>P.S. While it’s essential that we bombard the FCC with comments before the deadline tomorrow, we’re still going to have to keep the pressure on all summer, and ratchet it up even further when the decision time comes in the Fall. Want to help us win the battle for the net? </span><strong><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Please chip in $10 (or whatever you can afford) today.</a></strong></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:24 EDT on July 11, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://cispai" target="_blank"><strong><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8kb930wQ31ri3xd7.jpg?1512060081490"/></strong></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-6f39d44b-224a-9526-12af-729e38c275e3"><strong><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank">Take action now: Congress is racing toward a vote on CISA, a bill to end privacy.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>The Senate Intelligence Committee just rushed to approve “CISA,” a bill that would give the NSA </span><span>more</span><span> access to our data than ever before, </span><span>and</span><span> give companies like Facebook and Google legal immunity for violating our privacy. [1]<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Does “CISA” sound creepily familiar? <strong>That’s because it’s another zombified version of CISPA, a privacy-killing bill that Internet users have beaten back twice before,</strong> and that has been condemned by public advocacy groups from across the political spectrum as an urgent threat to online privacy and freedom of speech. [2]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank">Your signature is needed right now to stop CISA. Will you click here to take action? Every second counts, the Senate vote could happen quickly without warning &ndash; we need to raise our voices now before it’s too late. </a></strong><br/><span><br/>It’s despicable that the Senate Intelligence Committee, who are supposed to oversee the government’s spying programs and protect our rights, chose this moment to resurrect CISPA and advance it to the Senate floor. The explosive revelations of the past week offered further proof that the U.S. government continues to lie about the scope of its illegal spying operation [3], and revealed the harrowing stories of community leaders who were spied on solely because of their political and religious beliefs. [4]<br/><br/><strong>The Intelligence community is out of control. If we let CISA pass, we&rsquo;d be giving them more power than they&rsquo;ve ever had before. We can&rsquo;t let this happen.<br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to growing outcry against mass surveillance, it should be easier than ever to defeat legislation like CISA. But we can&rsquo;t pull our punches. There are powerful interests lobbying for this type of legislation, and they&rsquo;ve got *way* more money than us. [5] We&rsquo;ve got the public on our side, but it&rsquo;s up to us to mobilize.<br/></span><br/><span><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><strong>Congress is trying to do this quietly, so make noise! Click here to stop CISA now.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Kevin, and Holmes at Fight for the Future<br/></span></strong><span><br/>P.S. We can&rsquo;t stress enough how quickly this bill could move once it hits the Senate floor. It&rsquo;s now or never to get the word out. <strong>Please forward this email to everyone you know</strong> and share the petition on <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffightfortheftr%2Fphotos%2Fa.296919493661517.71630.283481148338685%2F785927948094000%2F%3Ftype%3D1%26theater" target="_blank">Facebook</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=RT+%40fightfortheftr%3A+Congress+is+trying+to+pass+CISPA+again%2C+this+time+it%27s+called+CISA+%26+it%27s+worse+than+the+original&amp;hashtags=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcispaisback.org&amp;related=Fightfortheftr" target="_blank">Twitter.</a></strong></span><strong><span><br/><br/>SOURCES:<br/></span></strong></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:38 EDT on July 11, 2014</span>


        <p><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8jyu08b7P1ri3xd7.jpg?1512060081490"/></p>

<p>Last year, Center for Rights and Fight for the Future helped thousands take action to call for the release of Barrett Brown, a citizen journalist and transparency activist whose trumped up charges set a chilling precedent for freedom of speech.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a link to our petition: <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/barrett-brown/" target="_blank">http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/barrett-brown/</a></strong></p>
<p>Please see below a statement directly from <a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/" target="_blank">FreeBarrettBrown.org</a></p>
<p><strong>&lt;3 Fight for the Future</strong></p>
<p>Today we have a tremendous support statement from <strong><a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/supporters/#pussyriot" target="_blank">Masha Alekhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova</a></strong>, the Russian dissidents known as Pussy Riot. Here&rsquo;s what they had to say about Barrett:</p>
<blockquote>“In Russia, where we live, the rights of journalists carry very little weight and people who aspire for a free press have much envy for the conditions in which media in the West usually functions. But cases that attack whistleblowers, journalists and activists allow Russian propaganda to point to foreign countries and say that “freedom of press” there similarly comes with the prosecution of journalists. Barrett’s case is one that should not be happening in a Western democracy and we hope that American authorities will not continue to set such a horrible example by giving Barrett any more time behind bars.&ldquo;</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong><a href="http://voiceproject.org/" target="_blank">The Voice Project</a></strong> and its executive director <strong><a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/supporters/#hunter" target="_blank">Hunter Heaney</a></strong> have signed on to the campaign to free Barrett Brown.<br/><br/> Without having heard from him, we suspect that Barrett is still being held in segregation since a June 17 &quot;semi-disturbance&rdquo; at Seagoville, which <strong><a href="http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/2014/07/01/the-barrett-brown-review-of-arts-and-letters-and-jail-a-visit-to-the-hole/" target="_blank">he wrote about in his last column</a></strong>. Many members of the public have been <strong><a href="http://www.bop.gov/inmates/concerns.jsp" target="_blank">expressing their concerns</a></strong> to the Bureau of Prisons. There&rsquo;s no word yet on when he will be released back to the regular population. Since he didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong and his behavioral record has been otherwise spotless, it&rsquo;s doubtful that he will be charged with an infraction following any disciplinary hearing. It&rsquo;s so hot in the hole that inmates strip to their underwear during the day — this is why the Texas Civil Rights Project is <strong><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/20/justice/texas-prison-heat-lawsuit/" target="_blank">suing over the lack of air-conditioning</a></strong> in Texas state prisons.<br/><br/> If you&rsquo;re attending the HOPE X (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference in NYC <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457146"><span class="aQJ">July 18-20</span></span>, there will be two panels related to Barrett Brown. <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457147"><span class="aQJ">On Friday at noon</span></span>, Brown&rsquo;s attorney Ahmed Ghappour, Anonymous expert Gabriella Coleman, and FreeBB director Kevin Gallagher <strong><a href="http://hope.net/schedule.html#barrettbro" target="_blank">will discuss his case and other matters</a></strong>.
