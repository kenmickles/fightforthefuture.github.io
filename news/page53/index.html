        <span class="date">Posted 13:43 EST on January 14, 2015</span>


        <p><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ni6jzmb0v51ri3xd7.png?1512060080605"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-12bec1b7-e923-0f2a-9aa8-2b1b6cfa319a"><span>So today we did something a little absurd. </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank">We launched 535 websites. One for each member of Congress. </a></strong></p>
<p><span>Why? The battle over net neutrality in the U.S. is coming to a final showdown, and the outcome will affect every Internet user in the world. One year ago today, Verizon’s lawyers got our net neutrality protections struck down in court. [1] </span></p>
<p><span>Since then,</span><span> we’ve unleashed an Internet-sized can of whoop-ass</span><span> on the FCC, the White House, fence-sitting tech giants, Team Cable lobbyists, and anyone else standing in the way of keeping the Internet open and unfettered by corporate and government interference.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank">Click here to tell Congress to stand with the Internet or get out of the way!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The online free speech movement has gained so much ground that Comcast and Verizon are now begging the FCC to implement the rules that just a year ago today </span><span>they sued to strike down.</span><span> [2]</span></p>
<p><span>We’re winning. We we&rsquo;re winning so hard. </span><strong>There’s literally only one thing that can stop us now: partisan nonsense in Congress.</strong></p>
<p><span>I know what you’re thinking: partisan nonsense in Congress can ruin ANYTHING. You’re right. That’s why we’re pulling out the stops on this one. </span><span>We made every member of Congress their very own website showing where they stand on net neutrality. Are they with the public or in bed with corporate monopolies that want to regulate the Internet?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard" target="_blank">Click here to find out if your member of Congress is helping kill net neutrality. Then share.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Congress knows that the public is overwhelmingly in support of net neutrality. We need to let them know that there will be political consequences for any politician who betrays the open Internet. </span><span>These sites are just the first part of the plan, but they’re exactly the kind of attention politicians don’t like.</span><span> It’s like if we put up giant billboards with their faces on them, except it only costs a couple bucks per site :-) </span></p>
<p><span>Congress has been scared of the Internet ever since SOPA. </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/?org=fftf" target="_blank"><span><span>Let’s keep it that way.</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Yours for the web,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Jeff, Kevin, and Vasjen</span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. The FCC decision is coming up at the end of next month and we need to bring on more people so we can kick our campaigns up a notch. </span><a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><span>Please chip in $10 to help if you can!</span></a></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:05 EST on January 14, 2015</span>


        <p><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ni6j0a1pb11ri3xd7.png?1512060080605"/></p>

<p>For Immediate Release<br/>January 14th, 2015<br/><br/>Media contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Net Neutrality Supporters Launch 535 Websites to Get Congress on the Record </strong></span>  <br/><br/><em>BattlefortheNet.com plans to light up phones on Capitol Hill to show widespread support for real open Internet protections</em></span></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Net Neutrality advocates launched 535 websites, one for each member of Congress, to identify where the officials stand on the open Internet and generate calls in favor of protections.<br/><br/> By visiting <strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard" target="_blank">BattlefortheNet.com/scoreboard</a></strong> users can locate their members’ websites and then contact their senators and representatives to urge support for Net Neutrality.<br/><br/> Each website notes whether that member of Congress is on “Team Internet” (a Net Neutrality supporter), “Team Cable” (a Net Neutrality opponent), or “unknown” (yet to make a statement for or against open Internet rules). <br/><br/> Demand Progress, Fight for the Future and the Free Press Action Fund launched this effort on the anniversary of the federal appeals court decision that struck down the FCC’s Open Internet Order and left Internet users without any protections against online discrimination and blocking.<br/><br/> After a year of public comments, advocacy and activism, the FCC is expected to issue a new Net Neutrality rule that will reclassify broadband Internet access as a Title II service under the Communications Act.<br/><br/> Protecting the rights of Internet users has become a leading political issue in recent years. As a new Congress gets to work in 2015, several members have proposed legislation to address Net Neutrality, but Congress already wrote the law that would protect Internet users.  <br/><br/> The FCC appears ready to restore for broadband the basic consumer protections Congress originally enacted for all two-way communications services. According to organizers of BattlefortheNet.com, members of Congress should not interfere with or delay the process unless they are willing to support the FCC’s efforts to preserve these fundamental protections.<br/><br/> “It’s time for members of Congress to either get on the right side of the Net Neutrality issue or get out of the way,” said Free Press Action Fund President and CEO <strong>Craig Aaron</strong>. “Millions of Americans have spoken out and the FCC is poised to give us the real Net Neutrality rules we need. Congress has already put in place the bipartisan legal framework that would make this a reality. The FCC now just needs to act by reclassifying Internet access under Title II.”</p>
<p>“Too often in Washington, well-heeled lobbyists get their way simply because the rules are too arcane for the average person, or even a member of Congress, to follow. Getting Internet policy right is too important to everyone. We can’t let the Internet’s future be decided by the highest bidder,” said Demand Progress Executive Director <strong>David Segal</strong>.</p>
<p>“Members of Congress should expect to hear from tens of thousands of constituents in the coming days as Internet users rise up once again in support of strong Net Neutrality rules,” said Fight for the Future Campaign Director <strong>Evan Greer</strong>. “Brace yourself, Congress. The Internet is coming.”</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-277e8f05-c138-d3be-d91e-10324850ff63"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>You’re going to like this. </span><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">We just built a new tool in the fight for net neutrality. Check it out!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Have you ever had a super frustrating situation with your Cable company &ndash; over your bill, their crappy service, slow connection, or whatever&ndash;and gotten upset with the customer service representative on the phone?</span></p>
<p><span>Hey, we’ve all been there. But the reality is those underpaid call center employees aren’t the ones to blame for your Cable bill catastrophe or that slow loading pinwheel on the video you want to stream.</span></p>
<p><span>Comcast’s top executives and lobbyists are laughing all the way to the bank while they make your Internet slow and keep your Cable bill sky high. Worse, they’re spreading blatant lies about net neutrality and throwing around millions of dollars in campaign contributions to buy off Congress and protect their monopoly power.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">These are the people who are to blame. And we found their phone numbers and email addresses. Click here to put all your frustration to good use and tell Comcast to stop lying.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Comcast has millions to spend on lobbying and and they can blanket Washington, DC in misleading ads. The public has a right to call and demand that they stop their campaign of deceit &ndash; and every minute that Comcast’s lobbyists spend on the phone with you is a minute they’re not spending trying to kill net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">Think about it. Now click here to call a Comcast lobbyist!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Thanks team! More soon.<br/>-Jeff at Fight for the Future</span><br/><br/><span>P.S. Comcast’s buddies in Congress are trying to pass a shady law called “Title X.” </span><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/stop-titlex" target="_blank">Click here to sign our urgent petition to stop them.</a></strong></p>

<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>Look, you don’t have time to read a long email, and I don’t have time to write one so I’ll get right to the point:</span><span> we are just $20,000 short of our year-end fundraising goal, and there’s still 48 hours left. </span><span>Can you help us close the gap so we don’t have to scale back our campaigns in the New Year?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=yearend2014version1" target="_blank">Please click here help us keep winning in 2015.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>2014 was an amazing year for Fight for the Future. T</span><span>hank you so much for being part of our growing movement to defend free speech in the digital age. </span><span>We’ve accomplished more together than any of the pundits or lobbyists thought was possible at this time last year and we should all be proud! </span></p>
<p><span>2015 will be critical year in the battle over the future of the Internet. </span><span>We’re doing the math right now and we know if we start off the New Year low on funds, we’re going to have to make tough choices about what to work on.</span><span> The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revival of CISPA, net neutrality, the MPAA’s latest attempt at SOPA, our ongoing work to end mass surveillance. Every single one of these campaigns is essential to the future of the web. Failure is not an option. </span><span>That’s why we’re asking for your help again.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=yearend2014version1" target="_blank">There’s still time! Please chip in to help us meet our goal and hit the ground running in the new year.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>I know we can do this</span><span>. Whether you can afford to chip in $3 or $3,000, we will make every penny of your donation count.</span><span> We are a tiny team. We all work from home on our laptops. We don’t have a big fancy office or any real overhead. We use every dollar that comes our way to fight as hard as we can to keep the Internet free and open. So many of you have given generously already and we thank you. If you can afford to chip in a few dollars more, it will really make a difference. If you can’t give this year, we totally understand. Thank you for being part of the team.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=yearend2014version1" target="_blank">Last chance. If you can, please click here to donate to support our work.</a></strong></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-316bb5f9-5ec7-ff5e-6378-225a3f253277"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>“Rectal feeding.” Wrongfully detained prisoners forced to stand on broken legs. Deaths from hypothermia. People missing. By now you’ve surely read the gruesome details from the CIA Torture Report. [1] Incredibly, the only person who is in jail as a result of this illegal program (and coverup) is &hellip; the whistleblower who exposed it. [2]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/pardonjohn" target="_blank">Sign the petition to pardon John Kiriakou, the CIA agent that exposed the torture program.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>As a CIA agent, John Kiriakou was ordered to commit inhumane acts of torture, but he refused. [3] He did what all of us would like to think we would do in that situation. Now the government is punishing him for doing the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span>In times like these, it’s critical we all stand up and hold our government accountable. We can start by gaining freedom for the person who helped shed light on these crimes. Then we can begin prosecuting the real perpetrators: the politicians who authorized this torture, and the CIA officials who hid it from the Senate and the public.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/pardonjohn" target="_blank">Click here to sign the petition to free John Kiriakou, the CIA torture report whistle blower.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Anytime the government cracks down on whistleblowers and those who tell the truth, all of our rights are undermined. Let’s stand up for John and stand up for the things we can all believe in: transparency and justice.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, Evan, and Jeff at FFTF</span></p>
