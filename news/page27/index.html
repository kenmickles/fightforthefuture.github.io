Backdoors in encryption put us all in danger, and make us more vulnerable to the types of attacks that the government says they’re trying to prevent.</i></p><p><i>Secure phones are saving lives every day. The engineers who maintain the IT behind airports, hospitals, power plants—they use iPhones too. If Congress makes our devices less secure by mandating backdoors, they’re putting hundreds of millions of lives at risk.</i></p><p><i>If we allow the government to set a precedent that they can force private companies to punch holes in the technological defenses that keep us safe, it’s not a question of if someone to will exploit that to cause harm to the public, it’s a question of when. Congress needs to listen to security experts by unequivocally supporting strong encryption and opposing backdoors.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future’s grassroots rallies at Apple stores in nearly 50 cities and at FBI headquarters last Tuesday garnered international headlines and sparked considerable online conversation. Protesters carried signs reading “Don’t Break Our Phones” and “Secure Phones Save Lives,” countering the narrative that this case is only about personal privacy and working to educate decision-makers about the serious dangers posed by weakening encryption technology.</p><p>The group, known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history, is planning another significant action opposing the FBI’s demand in the coming weeks. </p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future works to defend the Internet as a free and open platform for expression and creativity, and is best known for their role organizing the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sopastrike.com%2Fnumbers&amp;t=NjgyMTIxYjE4NzBjYTM1MGY1YTMwMTc3ZmUxODlhNDljOWFhZWZlMCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank">massive online protests</a> against SOPA, the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbattleforthenet.com%2Finfographic&amp;t=NGJjZmJhYWUyM2Y2MGQwMDhlMjNkODk2ZmI0MjQ3MDVmNjA2NDE3OCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a> for net neutrality, and the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fresetthenet.org%2F&amp;t=N2FiNjMyZmU5NTQzOTJkZjY0MzY0ZTYxNWY3ZTg0ODBjMDYxOTJkZCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank">Reset The Net</a> campaign promoting encryption and online security.

Today marks one week after the Justice Department won a court order that attempts to force Apple to write software that would undermine the safety and security of hundreds of millions of people.</p><p><b>Photos submitted from protests can be seen here:<a href="http://imgur.com/a/WIzWH" target="_blank"> http://imgur.com/a/WIzWH</a></b> </p><p>“People are rallying at Apple stores because what the FBI is demanding of Apple is going to make all of us less safe, not more safe,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. </b>“Encryption and security technology is what protects our hospitals, our airports, our water treatment facilities. If we allow the government to start forcing private companies to punch holes in these critical defenses, it’s not a question of if those backdoors will be exploited by those wishing to do harm, but when.”</p><p>Protesters opposed the DOJ’s demand, carrying giant<a href="http://i.imgur.com/w5HOowY.png" target="_blank"> <b>10-foot long iPhone banners</b></a><b>, </b>and iPhone shaped signs reading “FBI: Don’t Break Our Phones” and “Secure Phones Save Lives.” Participants also turned their phones, laptops, and tablets into glowing protest signs using<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fprotestsign.org&amp;t=OWI3ODkxMDllM2Q0ODIwY2U4MTgzZGY0YWM0MzAxNGI2MDEwMWU1MCxMM3JKVDZJcw%3D%3D" target="_blank"> <b>ProtestSign.org</b></a><b>.</b></p><p>The rallies were called for by Fight for the Future and are supported by Demand Progress, CREDO, and other advocacy organizations. Residents across the country immediately began to offer to host an event in their town and submitted the event to Fight for the Future, who provided banners and support with recruitment. Rallies were planned across the U.S. in small cities like Anchorage, Alaska, and major ones including New York, San Francisco, Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Boston. Outside the U.S., residents in London and Munich hosted rallies to express their concern about companies being forced to weaken encryption as a result of government pressure. This past Wednesday, San Francisco organizers hosted a rally with dozens of<a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/139516141773/photos-dozens-rally-at-apple-store-in-san" target="_blank"> <b>San Francisco</b></a><b> r</b>esidents that day on just a few hours notice.</p><p><b>Map with all submitted events by independent organizers:<a href="http://dontbreakourphones.org/" target="_blank"> DontBreakOurPhones.org</a></b></p><p>“Apple’s stand will help keep security threats at bay” said David Segal executive director of Demand Progress.  “But we will all be less safe if the FBI succeeds at its politically expedient, but shortsighted, approach.  Our devices will become more vulnerable and the sensitive data they hold will be more accessible to people who want it for malicious purposes.”</p><p>For interviews with Fight for the Future and Demand Progress staff members, please email <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future works to defend the Internet as a free and open platform for expression and creativity, and is best known for their role organizing the<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sopastrike.com%2Fnumbers&amp;t=NjgyMTIxYjE4NzBjYTM1MGY1YTMwMTc3ZmUxODlhNDljOWFhZWZlMCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank"> massive online protests</a> against SOPA, the<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbattleforthenet.com%2Finfographic&amp;t=NGJjZmJhYWUyM2Y2MGQwMDhlMjNkODk2ZmI0MjQ3MDVmNjA2NDE3OCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank"> Internet Slowdown</a> for net neutrality, and the<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fresetthenet.org%2F&amp;t=N2FiNjMyZmU5NTQzOTJkZjY0MzY0ZTYxNWY3ZTg0ODBjMDYxOTJkZCw0a01wcUtXQw%3D%3D" target="_blank"> Reset The Net</a> campaign for online security and privacy.</i></p>
