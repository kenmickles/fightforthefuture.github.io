      <h1><a href="/news/2017-01-23-fight-for-the-future-statement-regarding/">Fight for the Future statement regarding withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 10:09 EST on January 23, 2017</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="912" data-orig-width="1368"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/3b2d5572272d5869ae73bccb405eb90c/tumblr_inline_ok8ne8lwMo1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="912" data-orig-width="1368"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, January 23, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>CNN is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-withdrawal-trumps-first-executive-action-monday-sources-say/index.html?adkey=bn" target="_blank">reporting</a> that Donald Trump’s first executive action will be to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. It’s important for the public to understand the context of how the TPP was defeated. By the time the deal came up for a vote in Congress late last year, all the leading Presidential candidates opposed it, due to widespread opposition from across the political spectrum, sparked by a grassroots, years-long, international movement. This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/28/tpp-protests-mass-opposition-worked-trump-presidency" target="_blank">piece</a> in The Guardian chronicles some of that history.<br/></p><p>Fight for the Future, the digital rights group who organized many of the largest protests against the TPP in the United States, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p>“The victory against the TPP belongs to the people, not to Donald Trump or any other politician. </p><p>An unprecedented international movement of people and organizations from across the political spectrum came together, and lead nothing short of an uprising that stopped an outright corporate takeover of our democratic process. Together we sounded the alarm, and made the TPP so politically toxic that no presidential candidate who wanted to be elected could support it.</p><p>The TPP would have lead to widespread Internet censorship, undermined human rights, and devastated our economy and the planet. Corporations attempted to turn the deal into a wishlist for policies they knew they could not pass through a more transparent process. But an unlikely band of labor unions and tech companies, environmentalists, hackers, and Tea Party patriots took on the world’s largest and most powerful corporations, and we won.</p><p>As we enter a new stage in history, let the movement that stopped the TPP serve as a reminder to the incoming administration: we the people are organized and powerful. We will not tolerate attacks on our basic rights, whether they come from corporations or the government. If you come for our freedom, we will fight you and we will win.”</p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future has been instrumental in the movement against the TPP. They spearheaded the coalition behind <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fstopfasttrack.com&amp;t=YmI5MGJhNDBiZmU4ZjE4NWY3MjliYTZiYjcxOGZhY2ZjNmVjM2RiNCxBQXNqbVdRZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AKMlLl9GOPd0Y9ROFg2ygww&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.fightforthefuture.org%2Fpost%2F153056628623%2Ffight-for-the-future-statement-on-the-death-of-the&amp;m=1" target="_blank">StopFastTrack.com</a> that drove hundreds of thousands of emails and phone calls to Congress in opposition to Trade Promotion Authority legislation needed to pass the TPP, and organized creative stunts like<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWDKzwB8GhN0&amp;t=MTk4OTRiZGNjMWU4NWVhY2Q3ZTkxMmZkMGZkZGE3Y2YzMjQ5NzFlNSxBQXNqbVdRZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AKMlLl9GOPd0Y9ROFg2ygww&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.fightforthefuture.org%2Fpost%2F153056628623%2Ffight-for-the-future-statement-on-the-death-of-the&amp;m=1" target="_blank"> flying blimps</a> outside of fence-sitting Congress member’s offices.

The announcement comes amid growing public outcry about the plan, which would have given local police Orwellian capabilities to constantly scan and analyze online speech in the area.<br/></p><p>“This is a huge victory and offers a glimmer of hope for our basic rights at a time when it is in short supply,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, a group that led efforts to oppose the BPD’s surveillance aspirations, “Mass surveillance programs like the one the Boston Police intended to launch don’t actually make us safer, but they have a profoundly chilling effect on freedom of speech and our basic civil rights.”</p><p>Last month, digital rights group Fight for the Future and a dozen other civil liberties organizations <a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2016/12/13/boston-police-social-media-monitoring-opposition" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to the mayor and city council calling for them to halt the plan. In coordination with the Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU, they also collected thousands of signatures on <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/boston-police-want-14-million-to-buy-social-media-monitoring-software-2" target="_blank">a petition</a> from Bostonians opposed to the deal. </p><p>When the Boston Globe issued a misguided endorsement of the BPD plan, Greer wrote <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/58480bf6e4b0ca53e4b9c1ec?timestamp=1481117010651" target="_blank">a rebuttal</a>, which was widely shared. BPD drew even <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/letters/2017/01/05/boston-police-should-blocked-from-buying-new-surveillance-tools/ssyPDkqPBpUsZSb39MY2IK/story.html" target="_blank">more criticism</a> on the plan when it was revealed that they had bent the rules in the Boston Trust Act in order to hand over at least 9 people to federal immigration officials for deportation, violating a city policy preventing cops from getting involved in immigration enforcement.</p><p>“City governments and law enforcement agencies around the country should take note of what happened here in Boston. The public will not allow them to waste our tax dollars on dangerous tools that won’t make us safer but will enable mass discrimination and violations of our rights,” Greer added.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit best known for organizing the largest online protests in history against SOPA, for net neutrality, and against government surveillance.
