        <span class="date">Posted 10:43 EDT on August 14, 2015</span>

Now, Chelsea Manning has released charging documents she received from the U.S. Army on her Twitter account, handle @xychelsea. She has also released a photo of herself from February 2015, taken during the week she began hormone therapy.</p><p><b>View her tweets displaying the charging documents here: <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631953441779138561" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631953441779138561</a> and here: <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631954178332487680" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631954178332487680</a></b></p><p><b>View the tweet with her most recent photo to date: <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631955022285148160" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631955022285148160</a></b></p><p>Manning will have a hearing before the Discipline and Adjustment Board set for August 18th at 1:30pm CT, though her request to open the hearing to the public was denied on August 10th. The rules provide that she is not entitled to counsel of her own choosing and her fate will be determined by a three-person board.</p><p>Digital rights group Fight for the Future launched the original petition yesterday, August 12, at: <a href="https://www.freechelsea.com/" target="_blank">https://www.freechelsea.com/</a>. Within the last 24 hours, <a href="http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=11573" target="_blank">Roots Action</a> and <a href="http://act.demandprogress.org/sign/us-government-chelsea-manning-charges/" target="_blank">Demand Progress</a> also launched petitions. In total, over 50,000 people have added their name to demand the charges against Chelsea Manning be dropped and to request that the upcoming hearing be made open to the public.</p><p>Said Chase Strangio, one of Chelsea Manning’s attorneys in her civil case against the U.S. Department of Defense seeking access to health care related to gender transition:</p><p>&ldquo;This kind of action has the potential to chill Chelsea’s speech and silence her altogether. We are hopeful that the prison will respond by dismissing these charges and ensuring that she is not unfairly targeted based on her activism, her identity, or her pending lawsuit.&rdquo;</p><p>Said Nancy Hollander, lead counsel for Chelsea Manning’s criminal appeal:</p><p>“I am concerned that the prison authorities are going to continue harassing Chelsea whenever she speaks out or demands her rights. Asking for a lawyer is not disrespect.”</p><p>###</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-08-08-real-talk-about-the-tpp/">Real talk about the TPP</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:57 EDT on August 8, 2015</span>


        <p><i>This email is straight from the heart, so I apologize in advance if it’s too brutally honest. I hope you’ll read the whole thing, though, because the fight to stop the TPP affects all of us. <br/></i><br/><i>But, if you’ve only got a second, please<b> <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank">click here to chip in $5 to help us fight the TPP.</a></b></i></p><p><i>With love from the Internet,<br/>~ Evan</i></p><p>Dear Fight for the Future member,</p><p>Here’s the deal: last month, Congress passed “Fast Track” for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p><p><b>That means the TPP is now just one vote away from becoming law.</b></p><p>When Fast Track passed, it was heartbreaking. Over the last two years Fight for the Future built a totally unprecedented coalition of advocacy groups, tech companies, and activists fighting Fast Track, and together we were able to successfully defeat or delay Fast Track FIVE TIMES.</p><p>But in the end, pressure from the White House and an army of entrenched industry lobbyists was too much for Congress to resist, despite the overwhelming public outcry.</p><p>Now, we have a choice. We can just give up, and accept that democracy is over and the TPP is inevitable, or we can take matters into our own hands.</p><p><b>Here at Fight for the Future, we don’t believe in giving up. <br/></b><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank"><b>If you&rsquo;re the same way and want to fight the TPP to the end, click here to chip in $5 to help us stop it.</b></a></p><p>I can speak for myself and say that I personally can’t sleep at night unless I know I’m doing everything in my power to protect our most basic rights online and off.</p><p>Together, we have fought against insurmountable odds before and won — we killed SOPA, stopped CISPA, and just this year we won Net Neutrality. Now, we’re planning to win big again. We don’t care what the DC pundits say – we are going to stop the TPP. But we can’t do it alone.</p><p>Just last week, representatives from all 13 of the nations involved in the TPP met in Hawaii to finalize the deal — and they couldn’t do it. The sticking point? The intellectual property rights chapter where copyright and all of the worst provisions for the Internet are housed.</p><p>That means if anyone can stop the TPP, it’s us. But, to be frank, we are dangerously low on funds to continue fighting the TPP, and we need to do more than just continue. If we’re going to win, we need to take it to the next level.</p><p><b>Can you chip in to help make sure we have the resources to keep fighting and win?</b></p><p><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank"><b>Click here to chip in $5 to take on the TPP!</b></a></p><p>In emails like this, it’s common for groups to spread either doom and gloom or unsubstantiated optimism. I have neither of those for you today, just real talk.</p><p>The TPP is bad. Really bad. It’s arguably one of the worst things that could happen to the Internet, to our economy, and to the planet.</p><p>I can’t promise that we’re going to stop it. But I can promise that if we don’t try, it will certainly pass.</p><p><b>Can you chip in $5 to help us keep up the fight?</b></p><p><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank"><b>Yes, I’ll chip in $5 to help stop the TPP.</b></a></p><p>We plan to fight until the last breath, and we’re honored to have you fighting alongside us.</p><p>For the Internet,<br/>-Evan at Fight for the Future</p><p>P.S. Whether we win or lose on the TPP, the battle for the future of the Internet will rage on. To win these fights in the long run, we need to have consistent, ongoing support from people like you. The best way to do that is to chip in a small amount every single month. <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=longtpp8" target="_blank"><b>Click here to give $5 every month to keep us fighting.</b></a></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:45 EDT on August 5, 2015</span>


        <h2><i>Privacy &amp; free speech groups plan turn #FaxBigBrother on large Web companies after generating 6 million+ faxes to Senate, plus tens of thousands of phone calls and tweets ahead of expected CISA vote</i></h2><figure data-orig-width="667" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/2429f73162724ca031eb6325bdb631b6/tumblr_inline_nsmmyrXQji1ri3xd7_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="667" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><p>WASHINGTON, DC––Today, the Senate delayed until after August recess an expected cloture vote to begin debate of CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, a bill that experts say will actually make the U.S. <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/250070-is-cisa-gift-wrapped-for-hackers-and-nation-state-actors" target="_blank">more vulnerable to cyber attacks</a>, while <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/249521-cisa-the-dirty-deal-between-google-and-the-nsa-that-no-one-is" target="_blank">dramatically expanding</a> the government’s unpopular mass surveillance capabilities.</p><p>Following reports of the delay, <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a> the group responsible for flooding Congress with more than 6 million faxes as part of <a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">Operation: #FaxBig Brother</a>, announced they would be turning their viral campaign on large web companies who have been largely silent on the issue despite previous claims that they would fight in Congress for their customers privacy. Corporate offices of Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Dropbox, Microsoft, and other large companies can expect to start receiving a massive volume of faxes in the coming days.</p><p>Senate leadership had intended to move CISA to a cloture vote this afternoon, but failed to strike a deal as more and more members raised concerns with the bill in the wake of two weeks of <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/125427075193/breaking-activists-announce-staggering-61" target="_blank">intense grassroots action</a> that flooded Senate offices with more than 6.2 million faxes in addition to tens of thousands of emails, phone calls, and tweets. </p><p>Most of the action came through <a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">FaxBigBrother.com</a> a viral web page launched by Fight for the Future with a broad coalition of privacy and civil liberties groups. The campaign spread quickly on social media and was covered by The Guardian, TIME Magazine, CBS News, The Hill, Politico, and NPR’s All Things Considered. The six million faxes were also mentioned several times on the Senate floor by Senator Ron Wyden, a leading opponent of CISA.</p><p>To hammer home the scope of the opposition, Fight for the Future <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/629031383168610304" target="_blank">tweeted an image</a> showing that 6 million faxes, if printed out, would stand more than 4 times as tall as the Washington Monument. <br/></p><p>“Today’s delay is good news, but Internet users are outraged that Congress is even considering this dangerous and unpopular legislation, and even more outraged at the Web companies who stand to benefit financially from CISA’s sweeping legal immunity who have remained silent, putting all of their users&rsquo; privacy at risk,” <b>said Evan Greer, Fight for the Future’s campaign director.</b></p><p>“Internet users are losing trust in the websites they use, and bills like CISA are a perfect example of why,”<b> said Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng. </b>“As the Senate debates CISA, any technology company that doesn’t stand by their own privacy policy and refuse to be an informant for the government’s suspicionless spying programs will see their users abandon them. If CISA passes, these companies will be seen as spies for the NSA, greatly expanding the government&rsquo;s watch lists and wrongful targeting of more and more Internet users. That will be the beginning of a giant backlash against those who once stood for the open Internet.”</p><p>###</p>

Sign up to get these updates by taking action at <a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">FaxBigBrother.com</a></i></p><p>Hey,<br/></p><p>I just got off the phone with a colleague in DC and I have bad news. Mitch McConnell has moved the Senate toward a cloture vote on CISA, the bill that puts companies like Facebook above the law and lets them share all your private data with the government and local cops. [1]</p><h2><a href="https://www.cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><b>Deadline TONIGHT: Click here to take urgent action to stop CISA. </b></a></h2><p>We’ve changed the political landscape in the last week, and more and more media outlets are reporting on the fact that CISA (which stands for Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act) won’t stop security breaches like the OPM hacks, and might even make us more vulnerable. [2] </p><p>But we need more than 40 Senators to vote “NO” in the next 24 hours or we will almost definitely lose. Time is everything. We simply can’t waste this opportunity to stop CISA or we will regret it for years to come.</p><h2><a href="https://www.cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><b>Click here to tell Congress that CISA won’t stop cyber attacks. They need to hear from you TODAY.</b></a></h2><p>We have rules that protect people from unreasonable search and seizure for a reason. CISA would invalidate both the Fourth Amendment and every company’s privacy policy in one fell swoop. The stuff the government will gain access to is really scary and personal. Think private emails, and stuff like financial and medical records. </p><p>I don’t want my kid to grow up in a world without privacy, because a world without privacy is a world without freedom of thought, a world without progress. </p><h2><a href="https://www.cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><b>Please join me in taking action today. We’ve made it easy: just click here to contact your lawmakers. </b></a></h2><p>Thanks for all that you do,</p><p>-Evan at FFTF</p><p>P.S. Remember when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDKzwB8GhN0" target="_blank">we flew a 30 foot blimp</a> over all of Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings to protest his terrible position on the TPP? Well we’re still mad about his corrupted position on that issue, but we’re pragmatic enough to say that EVERYONE should read <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/29/congress-stop-high-profile-hacks-reduce-your-privacy" target="_blank">his op-ed in The Guardian</a> about how CISA means that 12+ government agencies and even local cops could have access to all your private internet data, your medical records, and more. It’s one of the clearest explanations of how this bill works that I’ve read.</p><p>SOURCES:<br/>[1] The Hill: <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/249521-cisa-the-dirty-deal-between-google-and-the-nsa-that-no-one-is" target="_blank">http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/249521-cisa-the-dirty-deal-between-google-and-the-nsa-that-no-one-is</a> </p><p>[2] The Hill: <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/250070-is-cisa-gift-wrapped-for-hackers-and-nation-state-actors" target="_blank">http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/250070-is-cisa-gift-wrapped-for-hackers-and-nation-state-actors</a> </p>
