<p><span>###</span></p>
<p><strong>Dear Fight for the Future member,</strong></p>
<p>You did it! Late last night — after they were bombarded by calls from FFTF members and many others — the U.S. House of Representatives <strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/20/congress-obama-nsa-reform-obama-senate" target="_blank">overwhelmingly voted to cut funding for some of the NSA’s most nefarious backdoor spying programs.</a></strong></p>
<p>There’s no question about it. The tides are turning. We didn’t just win this vote, we won it by a landslide. 293-123.</p>
<p>Our movement is showing it’s power, and organized Internet users are once again proving to be a more formidable force than the U.S. government (or any of the pundits) expected.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go. No matter what happens in Congress, we will need to continue our Reset the Net effort to secure the web through technology. As we know all too well, governments often bend and break the rules they set for themselves, and so far the reforms on the table in Congress don’t do nearly enough to protect the rights of people outside the U.S.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain: we are gaining ground, and the NSA is losing it. We’re beating them back with technology, pushing politicians to cut their funding, and dragging their secretive programs out into the sunlight for all to see.</p>
<p>This vote in congress didn’t happen by magic. So many of us have spoken out in the last year and made it clear in no uncertain terms that mass surveillance is not okay. Our movement has become too big for Congress to ignore. We forced them to go on record supporting change.</p>
<p>We still have much work to do, but today is a day worth celebrating! More soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, and Evan<br/>Fight for the Future</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:05 EDT on June 18, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7doypPJOX1ri3xd7.png?1512060081605"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-5893f9a4-b03e-c86b-4ae0-5ab5c716201f"><span><strong>Dear Fight for the Future member,</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Last year, we were 12 votes shy of defunding the NSA&rsquo;s phone spying program&rsquo;s with a last minute amendment. Now we have a chance for another sneak attack, but we could have less than 24 hours to implement it and push it over the edge. Today or tomorrow, U.S. Congress will vote on an Amendment to the &ldquo;must-pass&rdquo; Defense funding bill that &ndash; if it gets enough yes votes &ndash; could close up the backdoors the NSA has been using to spy on all of us (1).</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">This is a significant silver bullet to disrupt the NSA’s blanket spying. But time is running out. Click here to take action right now!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This Amendment is different. It’s not a big clunky bill that we can expect to get watered down by the corrupt leadership of both parties, it’s more of a Congressional guerilla tactic. Rep. Zoe Lofgren is tacking this Amendment on to the Defense Appropriations Bill, a bill that basically has to pass. She’s forcing the question &ndash; the Amendment basically says that the NSA can’t use any of the funds it’s given to conduct warrantless searches under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and it also prevents them from building back doors into security products (2).</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Congress doesn’t get many calls about amendments like this. Your voice matters! Click here to contact your reps.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember the Amash Amendment that no one thought had a chance, and then it almost passed and would have defunded some of the NSA’s programs? (3). </strong><span>If we can flood Congress with calls and emails right now, we can cut off one of the NSA’s octopus arms, and actually stop them from using our own tax dollars to spy on us. </span><strong>The vote could happen as early as this afternoon.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://shutthebackdoor.net/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Click here to to demand that Congress protect our rights and shut the backdoor the NSA has been using to invade our lives.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’re busy building the next phase of Reset the Net, our ongoing campaign to rid the Internet of mass surveillance through the massive spread of encryption technology, but in the meantime, this is a quick, easy, and satisfying way to make another dent in the NSA’s armor.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all that you do,<br/>Evan, Tiffiniy, and Kevin<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. We think it’s important that we all take action today and help this Amendment pass if at all possible. But we also recognize it’s limitations. Everyone in the world deserves privacy, not just U.S. citizens. That’s why we’re continuing to build a global movement around Reset the Net.

        <span class="date">Posted 16:28 EDT on June 16, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7a3izU2MF1ri3xd7.png?1512060081605"/></a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Dear Fight for the Future member,<br/><br/>We know how to fight the NSA. Finally.<br/><br/>It’s been one year since the Snowden leaks and, with Reset the Net, I feel like we just landed our first real punch, and got our first real result. <strong>Now the question is: can we keep fighting?</strong><br/><br/>Reset the Net worked so well. Huge services like Tumblr, Wordpress, and Sendgrid announced new encryption that–thanks to Snowden–we <em>know</em> makes spying harder. Meanwhile, thousands of sites (including Minecraft, one of the world’s most-downloaded games) drove downloads of encrypted calling and texting tools all day on Thursday.<br/><br/>Not a techie? Well, to the NSA, that means our private conversations will increasingly look like this: “I9XJKigrOgyymB1oEtF37xoKDzXuS5NbbRGT5Rq4GA1VCJYC”<br/><br/>The scale of what we’re achieving is just staggering. Sendgrid alone delivers <em>billions</em> of emails each month. Now, those emails are encrypted, safer.<br/><br/><strong>So we can’t stop now, but this is intense work!</strong> Last week was a huge lift for our small team. We think we can get dozens, maybe <em>hundreds</em> more huge sites to step up. But to do it, we&rsquo;ll need a full-time organizer: someone to approach sites, convince them to join, and plan more days of action. <strong>Can you donate to keep Reset the Net going?</strong><br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s winning against NSA mass surveillance.</strong></a><br/><br/>Our tiny organization is facing a battle on <em>two</em> fronts. We are finally making dents in the NSA’s surveillance system, but meanwhile America’s cable monopolies are attacking the fundamental principles of the open Internet–the ones that make campaigns like this possible. <strong>Alone, either of these would be the fight of our lives. Together, it’s almost more than we can handle.</strong><br/><br/>But we think we can do both, and we have to: each win means so much. Reset the Net was 6 months of work. Now that the campaign structure is in place, we just need to keep adding sites to our roster, and encouraging sites who&rsquo;ve already joined to keep pushing the envelope.<strong> We don’t need expensive design or development help, just one driven full-time organizer.</strong> Someone who can keep nudging this snowball forward, until it becomes an avalanche. Can you pitch in?<br/><br/><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Yes, I’ll donate to a strategy that’s shutting down NSA mass surveillance, piece by piece.</strong></a><br/><br/>This is what victory looks like. Sincerely,<br/><br/>Evan, Holmes, Tiffiniy and the whole Fight for the Future team<br/><br/>P.S. We are serious. If this email goes well we are hiring an organizer right now. Interested? Reply with links to work you’ve done.</p>

<p><span>So how did we do it? Check out this infographic</span><span>. We promise you will end up reading the whole thing and then feeling awesome. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank">Click here to see how we Reset the Net.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>There’s so much more to tell. We’re still tallying up the numbers and collecting all the amazing stories of how the Internet came together to defend itself.</span></p>
<p><span>And, we’re making the biggest announcement of all.</span><span> Reset the Net was not just a single day of action. We’re going to continue this campaign as a longterm, concerted effort to directly  block dragnet government surveillance from as much of the Internet as we can. </span></p>
<p><span>Each month we’ll be announcing a new wave of participants who are helping Reset the Net, and escalating our demands on the largest tech companies to ensure that they’re taking the most meaningful and concrete steps they possibly can to protect our privacy.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank">This is only the beginning. But it was a HUGE beginning. Click here to see how much of the web we already protected on June 5th.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Thanks for being part of this. We’ll be in touch soon with the next steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, Vasjen, Jessica<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. None of this would have been possible without the sustaining donations we receive from our members. We need to keep this effort going. </span><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span>Will you please chip in $20 (or more!) today to support our work?</span></a></p>
<p><span>P.P.S. We&rsquo;re looking for a better version, but here&rsquo;s a quick video of Edward Snowden speaking via telecast at PDF in New York City issuing an inspiring call to action in support of Reset the Net:<br/></span></p>
