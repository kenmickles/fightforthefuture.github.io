        <figure data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/c1d5746e8403864c0cddd8b5b9784787/tumblr_inline_ohoimeBSQF1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456"/></figure><p><i>This post was written by Lilia Villa, a former FFTF campaigner who is currently at Standing Rock. Photos by Lilia Villa as well.</i></p><p>We call on all Internet users to educate themselves, <b><a href="http://www.ocetisakowincamp.org/" target="_blank">get involved</a>,</b> and help spread the word about what is happening in North Dakota at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.<br/></p><p>Native Americans who are speaking out have been brutally attacked and placed under extreme surveillance by the U.S. government. Most recently a young woman was severely injured and may lose her arm after police fired concussion grenades into a crowd. [1] We fight to defend the Internet for exactly these moments&ndash;when human rights are being trampled and the world needs to pay attention.</p><p>The Army Corps of Engineers <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/people-delivering-supplies-to-protest-camp-could-get-fine/article_9b017156-f1c2-5f02-9261-d2821c1fdfbe.html" target="_blank">has issued</a> an eviction notice to the Standing Rock water protectors, claiming they will not have permission to camp there after December 5th. A spokesperson for the Morton County Sheriff’s department has said that if they stay, &ldquo;they have to live with the consequences of potentially freezing to death.&rdquo; They have also warned that those delivering supplies could face up to a $1k fine. We can only assume the human rights situation will worsen if the government moves ahead with this plan.</p><p>As you read this, Dakota Access Pipeline, LLC, is knowingly plowing through sacred sites, burial grounds, and preparing to drill under the river without a permit &ndash; threatening the water supply of nearly 18 million Americans and the nation’s largest aquifer [2] &ndash; all with what appears to be full support from both state and federal authorities.  </p><p>Water Protectors, as the #NoDAPL movement has asked to be called, continue to be brutalized with excessive militarized force while praying peacefully in opposition.[3] Major news networks have failed to cover the story on television, making social media instrumental in helping indigenous people share the continued oppression and human rights violations as they play out in real time on Facebook Live - feeding the growing resistance in solidarity that’s now become an international movement.  </p><figure data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/2eb44b7e7aa5f602fd33d62a8e483eed/tumblr_inline_ohoip1P0cM1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456"/></figure><p>It’s a big deal. Over 300 indigenous tribes from across the US and around the world have converged along with thousands of allies for what many have called “the largest, most diverse tribal action in at least a century, perhaps since Little Bighorn.” [4] </p><p>While technology has helped them tell their story and find support, even more powerful people and institutions are using technology to conduct indiscriminate surveillance and suppression of free speech. </p><p>You may have noticed your Facebook timeline erupting with what seemed like friends traveling and “checking in” to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota in the last few weeks. According to a viral post, the flood of check-ins was intended to “overwhelm and confuse” police agencies, saying that the Morton County Sheriff’s Department had been using check-ins to identify and “target” water protectors. [5]</p><figure data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/90efeb8f5992c33cb5c78c1f962bda80/tumblr_inline_ohoipmAM7e1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456"/></figure><p>Law enforcement and private DAPL security have maced, tear gassed, shot rubber bullets, exploded CS (tear gas) grenades, sprayed water cannons in sub-zero temperatures, and released attack dogs on water protectors. They have arrested hundreds so far, targeting indigenous people and leaders, and even caged some in dog kennels [6]&ndash; all for praying to defend their land and their drinking water. Both the UN and Amnesty International are now monitoring the human rights abuses happening at Standing Rock as public outrage keeps growing.</p><p>With more than 1.5 million check-ins, it was probably the largest counter-surveillance action ever taken. </p><p>Putting aside the effectiveness of it, the Facebook users that checked in at Standing Rock water protector camps believed they were creating cover for activists who were actually there, and whose social media presence was being monitored by law enforcement. That means over 1.5 million people worked together to protect indigenous people, and to evade the ubiquitous surveillance of our social networks by law enforcement. That is huge. </p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="2268" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/0bf1b42e4b35f9ed4b707e8341979807/tumblr_inline_ohoipyQ4sB1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="2268"/></figure><p>But law enforcement has been doing more than just following social media posts. Signs of illegal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher" target="_blank">IMSI catcher</a> intrusion, or &ldquo;stingrays,&rdquo; and other surveillance tactics have been reported on the ground. Cell phone communications and video live feeds have been disrupted, often at critical times when law enforcement attacks on the water protectors are most intense. </p><p>“People have reported having their phones misbehaving in odd ways. Batteries dying without warning are the most common reports. But there are creepier incidence, like FaceTime turning on by itself, voice recorders activating, apps malfunctioning, browsers seizing, messages disappearing, and strange noises during calls. My iPhone reset itself as if brand new from the box in my first week at Standing Rock.&ldquo; [7]</p><p>On October 20, the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) and the ACLU submitted FOIA and Open Records Requests to investigate the possible use of unconstitutional surveillance at Standing Rock. [8] In the press release, they noted that “Water Protectors and allies have been continuously surveilled by low-flying planes, helicopters, and drones, and have had local cell phone communications jammed and possibly recorded.” </p><p>What is happening at Standing Rock is an unprecedented crisis, and we are all witness to it. It is inexcusable to have, on American soil, a racist policy being enforced with police brutality, censorship, human rights abuses, and to have silence from our elected officials in response. Also, climate change is real, it threatens all of us, and actions to slow and stop fossil fuel infrastructure—while the world transitions to solar energy—are the front lines of the fight.</p><figure data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/e0518920adf1d7af956c9066271ea7d5/tumblr_inline_ohoiqkL4DD1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456"/></figure><p>We stand in solidarity with the water protectors at Standing Rock and ask anyone who wants to support their efforts to visit the websites for <a href="http://www.ocetisakowincamp.org/" target="_blank">Oceti Sakowin Camp</a>, <a href="http://sacredstonecamp.org/" target="_blank">Sacred Stone Camp</a>, and the <a href="https://medichealercouncil.com/" target="_blank">Standing Rock Medic + Healer Council</a> to get involved in their efforts.

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-11-29-urgent-the-fbi-cia-and-other-law-enforcement/">URGENT: The FBI, CIA, and other law enforcement agencies get expanded powers to hack into your computer and phone on Thursday, December 1. Some senators are pushing legislation to stop them, but they need more senators to join them immediately.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 10:20 EST on November 29, 2016</span>


        <p>Beginning at midnight on Thursday, December 1, 2016, anyone who uses a VPN, Tor browser, or other privacy protection tools can more easily get hacked by the government.<br/></p><p>The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are scheduled to get expanded powers to remotely access and search computers, phones, and storage devices in cases where people suspected of being “related” to a crime  use technological means to conceal their location. <br/></p><p>That is, unless Congress takes action to stop these hacking powers from taking effect. </p><p>Under current criminal procedure rules, if the FBI or any other agency wants to hack into your computer, they need to get a warrant from a federal judge located within your federal judicial district. Under a new <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/proposed-amendment-rule-41.pdf" target="_blank">amendment</a> to the rule that takes effect on Thursday, if you use encryption, disable location tracking, or have been a botnet victim, the FBI can get a warrant to hack you from any of the <a href="http://www.fedbar.org/PDFs/A-Guide-to-the-Federal-Magistrate-Judge-System.aspx?FT=.pdf" target="_blank">more than 500</a> federal magistrate judges around the country. </p><p>So, if the FBI wants to hack you but they don’t have evidence that passes muster with your local federal judge, they will be able to take their case to a more lenient (or more naïve) judge located anywhere in the country. </p><p>Another clause in the rule change would let any federal judge authorize hacking operations for multiple devices in cases involving the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. That means if you are a victim of a botnet or had your computer infected by some malware, the government could remotely hack you under a mass hacking warrant issued by any federal judge. </p><p>The rule change was never voted on—or even debated—by Congress. It comes from the Judicial Conference, the national policy-making body for the federal courts, which earlier in the year agreed to a FBI proposal to amend Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrmP) so they could get warrants to hack multiple computers in different districts. The Judicial Conference has authority to make technical changes to the rules governing criminal proceedings, but this proposal goes way beyond mere technicalities and should be subject to public and legislative debate.  </p><p><b>We don’t have much time, but we can still stop the government from getting these new mass hacking powers. <b><a href="http://www.decidethefuture.org/" target="_blank"><b>Dial 1-919-FREEDOM or use this page to get connected with your senators</b></a>.</b><br/></b></p><p>A bipartisan group of senators and representatives is pushing legislation to block the Judicial Conference’s amendment or at least delay it for a few months so Congress can hold a debate. They will be bringing their bills to the floor for unanimous consent consideration on Tuesday and Wednesday.

We did.</p><p>An unprecedented grassroots movement of people and organizations from across the political spectrum came together to spark an uprising that stopped what would have been nothing less than an outright corporate takeover of our democratic process. Together we sounded the alarm, and made the TPP so politically toxic that no presidential candidate who wanted to be elected could support it. </p><p>The TPP would have globalized Internet censorship, undermined civil liberties, and devastated our economy and our planet.  </p><p>An unlikely band of labor unions and tech companies, environmentalists, hackers, and Tea Party patriots took on the world’s largest and most powerful corporations, and we won.</p><p>As we enter a new stage in history, let the movement that stopped the TPP serve as a reminder to the powerful: we are many, and you are few. We will no longer accept blatant political corruption in the form of rigged “trade” deals negotiated in secret. We will fight for the future of free speech and democracy, and in long run, we will always win.”</p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future has been instrumental in the movement against the TPP.

        <span class="date">Posted 11:12 EDT on November 4, 2016</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1399" data-orig-width="2048"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/ece97ce07c3af2b60d8f08f741b02015/tumblr_inline_og4i5aK5KR1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1399" data-orig-width="2048"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, November 4, 2016<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, (978) 852-6457<br/><br/>PITTSBURGH, PA––Hundreds packed into Mr Smalls Theater in Pittsburgh last night to protest the anti-democratic Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement at the “Rock Against the TPP” concert headlined by legendary political punk band Anti-Flag. The event was part of a nationwide tour featuring high profile musicians and celebrities raising awareness about controversial deal, which is expected to come up for a vote in Congress during the “lame duck” session after the election.<br/></p><p><b>See PHOTOS of the event available for use by press here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/I9RrK" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/I9RrK</a> </b></p><p><b>See a short VIDEO from the finale of the event here: <a href="https://youtu.be/p8ngUeInoKw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/p8ngUeInoKw</a> </b></p><p>The concert also featured renowned Pittsburgh folksinger Anne Feeney along with Downtown Boys, Taina Asili, Ryan Harvey, Son of Nun, </p><p>The TPP has little to do with trade, but instead grants multinational corporations extraordinary new powers to threaten jobs, the environment, affordable medicine, free speech, and food safety. </p><p>Anti-Flag are one of the most popular musical acts to emerge from Pittsburgh, and tour extensively performing politically charged punk rock that’s half circle pit, half picket line. The band issued the following statement ahead of the November 3rd concert: &ldquo;The Rock Against The TPP shows that we have played across the US and Canada were so amazing that we had to curate one in our beloved hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - Pittsburgh, an international epicenter of the labor movement  - a city where union loyalty and the fight for human rights courses through the veins of its citizens to this very day. The Rock Against The TPP shows are beyond educational, they&rsquo;re inspirational. They are a true testament to music&rsquo;s ability to bring people together and create positive change; a rally to energize us all to continue to fight against The TPP and all of the ills it will bring to the world.&rdquo;</p><p>“The Trans-Pacific Partnership is not about ‘free trade,’ it’s about corruption,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future and lead organizer of the tour, “we’re harnessing the power of music and culture to sound the alarm about this corporate power grab and stop it in its tracks.”</p><p>Organized by digital rights group Fight for the Future in partnership with legendary guitarist Tom Morello (Prophets of Rage, Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and riot-folk singer Ryan Harvey’s record label Firebrand Records, previous stops on the Rock Against the TPP tour have featured high-profile participants including actress Evangeline Lilly, hip hop icon Talib Kweli, comedian Hari Kondabolu, Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, legendary punk band Anti-Flag, Danbert Nobacon of the UK sensation Chumbawamba, and ANTI records songwriter Jolie Holland. The roadshow has already drawn <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WMeQZ" target="_blank">large crowds</a> in Denver, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Toronto.</p><p>The Rock Against the TPP tour brings together a broad coalition of supporters including digital rights groups, labor unions, environmental groups, and small businesses, and is sponsored by Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America (CWA), CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, the Teamsters, and United Steelworkers. The Pittsburgh stop was also backed by the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, PA Fair Trade Coalition, and Fight Back Pittsburgh.</p><p>For Interviews with artists or organizers, please contact Evan Greer at <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> or (978) 852-6457.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.rockagainstthetpp.org</a> </p><p># # #</p>
