Specifically, I&rsquo;d like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>You can also just call this number directly and enter your zipcode to get connected to your legislators: <b>202-930-8550.</b></p><p>If you run a website, blog, tumblr, or forum, help spread the word by putting up a sticky post, or use one of these widgets, ads, or banners: <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join" target="_blank">https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join</a></p><p>Ajit Pai is expected to circulate the text of his rule killing net neutrality on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving. Once that happens, it will move to a vote at the FCC’s open meeting in December, and it will become much much harder to stop him.</p><p>It’s clear that the FCC remains set on killing net neutrality. But Congress can stop the FCC from gutting the rules that keep the web open, affordable, and awesome.</p>

The group has previously targeted 9 members of Congress who have publicly supported Ajit Pai’s plan to slash Title II protections, but these four represent the first Democrats to be targeted as part of the crowdfunded campaign.</p><p><b>See a mockup of what the billboards will look like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hfsp5" target="_blank">here.</a></b></p><p>“Every member of Congress needs to understand that you can’t vote against the free and open Internet and get away with it,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,</b> “let this be a lesson to any lawmaker considering going against the interests of their constituents to support legislation or FCC action that undermines existing net neutrality rules.”</p><p>“The only interests Ajit Pai represents are those of the few gatekeeper media companies that want to charge people more for nothing and give them less of everything,” <b>said Candace Clement, Free Press Action Fund Campaign Director. </b>“Those in Congress who voted to confirm Ajit Pai did so against the demands and interests of their constituents. Pai stands against an open internet, online privacy, local control of local media and affordable access for everyone. Team Internet will continue to remind Congress that you can’t do harm to the people you represent without hearing from us every day and everywhere. You can’t sell out our rights in Washington without consequences.” </p><p>“By voting to confirm Ajit Pai, these senators fundamentally failed Americans who rely on, or are in need of an open and affordable internet,” <b>said Mark Stanley, Director of Operations for Demand Progress.</b> “A vote for Pai was a vote to end net neutrality protections. It was a vote for less affordable broadband service for those who need it most. And it was a vote for greater media consolidation, which will lead to higher costs and worse service for consumers. Pai’s vision for our country&rsquo;s communications networks is overwhelmingly unpopular among the public. Constituents are watching intently, and going forward it is incumbent on lawmakers from both parties to unequivocally oppose Pai and his policies that place the interests of Big Cable over those of ordinary Americans.”</p><p>Demand Progress, Free Press Action Fund, and Fight for the Future were the leading groups behind the massive July 12 net neutrality day of action, which drove a <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-13-update-historic-day-of-action-for-net-neutrality/" target="_blank"><b>record breaking</b></a> number of comments, calls, and emails, to the FCC and Congress.</p><p>###</p>

Fight for the Future launched a <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/dctravel/#page-1" target="_blank"><b>crowdfunding page</b></a> where net neutrality supporters who couldn’t attend the meetings in DC could chip in to help cover travel costs for others who need assistance.</p><p>“The companies trying to kill net neutrality are spending millions on lobbyists who are hitting the Hill constantly to spread fear and misinformation,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“Internet users, entrepreneurs, and small business owners have such critically important stories to tell about how Title II net neutrality protections directly impact their basic rights and their ability to put food on the table. Tomorrow, we’re harnessing the power of the Internet to make sure that those stories are heard over the noise of the telecom lobby.”</p><p>&ldquo;A free and open internet is the lifeblood of small business in America, and Net Neutrality as protected in Title II, is what guarantees that the internet remains free and open,” <b>said Sean Frame, who runs a video production company in California and is traveling to DC to participate in the meetings,</b> “My business, and the businesses of my clients cannot survive if we are placed in the internet slow-lane while larger competitors buy faster access.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Lesley Perg, who is traveling from Minnesota, said</b>, &ldquo;I am a PhD climate scientist on the American Care Act, an avid backpacker in our National Parks, and I tutor mainly immigrants and people of color in Adult Basic Education and Citizenship. A free and open internet is imperative for a functioning democracy, and if we give away our infrastructure now, I believe it will be difficult to impossible to overturn in the future. Net Neutrality underlies all the causes that are important to me - that&rsquo;s how I picked my battle.&rdquo;</p><p><b></b></p><p>“As a small business owner net neutrality is very important to me to make sure I can compete against large corporations,” a<b>dded Alison Stanton, who is traveling from Illinois, </b>“ I&rsquo;m scared I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to reach potential customers if we lose net neutrality because it would be too expensive to communicate with them.”</p><p>In addition to Fight for the Future, organizations supporting the Day of Advocacy include Public Knowledge, Center for Media Justice, Common Cause, EFF, Consumers union, Free Press, and Writers Guild of America West. </p><p>###</p>

The <a href="https://www.keepthewebopenforbusiness.com/FCC_17-108_smallbusiness-ASBC-filing-170830.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a>, filed with the FCC by the American Sustainable Business Council, warns that “weakening or rolling back the 2015 protections would be disastrous for the country’s business community” who for decades have relied on open access to the open Internet to do business.</p><p>The signatories–ranging from dentist offices to sporting goods stores–highlight how the FCC’s proposed changes would put smaller business at a disadvantage with larger companies. Without strong protections Internet service providers (ISPs) would be permitted to block websites, slow traffic, or charge new access fees. The businesses warn policymakers that, “While big companies might be able to afford a pay-to-play prioritized ‘fast lane’ to users, small and medium sized enterprises like ours cannot.”</p><p>Small and medium sized businesses are encouraged to <a href="https://www.keepthewebopenforbusiness.com/#letter" target="_blank">sign on</a>, as names are being added on rolling basis at <b><a href="https://www.keepthewebopenforbusiness.com/" target="_blank">KeepTheWebOpenForBusiness.com</a>. </b></p><p>“These businesses represent their founders’ dreams for a better life and a better world—and they’re how many families put food on the table and pay their bills each month,” <b>said Fight for the Future co-founder Holmes Wilson,</b> “The FCC’s plan to end net neutrality puts businesses like these—and the livelihoods of the millions of people that depend on them—in grave danger.”</p><p>The letter was filed on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/today-is-your-last-chance-to-comment-on-the-proposal-to-kill-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">final day</a> of the FCC’s controversial net neutrality consultation, which sparked millions of comments, emails, and phone calls in support of Title II following the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/net-neutrality-day-of-action-fcc-comments/" target="_blank">July 12th day of action</a>. Earlier this week digital rights group Fight for the Future released a <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/more-net-neutrality-billboards-go/168195" target="_blank">second wave</a> of billboards targeting members of Congress who support the FCC’s repeal, building on an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/pro-net-neutrality-billboards-shame-lawmakers-who-want-to-repeal-rules/" target="_blank">initial round</a> of six billboards from earlier this month. The ads are currently running in nine different states while lawmakers are back in their home districts.</p><p>Fight for the Future is best known for their role in the massive online protests against SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, and continues to organize many of the largest protests in the history of the Internet. They recently organized the high profile Rock Against the TPP tour, as well as historic July 12th Internet-wide day of action to save net neutrality.

      <h1><a href="/news/2017-08-30-cable-industrys-own-study-shows-their-plan-to/">Cable industry’s own study shows their plan to kill net neutrality is as unpopular as ever</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:44 EDT on August 30, 2017</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, August 30, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>While FCC’s refusal to address cybersecurity issues and fake comments creates intentional confusion around data, unique comments are overwhelmingly in favor of Title II net neutrality— by more than 73 to 1</i></h2><p>Today, the telecom industry is touting <a href="http://www.emprata.com/reports/fcc-restoring-internet-freedom-docket/" target="_blank">a study</a> funded by cable lobby group Broadband for America regarding the millions of comments submitted to the FCC’s public docket surrounding the agency’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality rules that prevent companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon from charging extra fees, throttling apps and services, and censoring online content.</p><p><b>The most telling statistic in the report is that the unique comments in the docket &ndash; the ones that people took the extra time to write themselves &ndash; are overwhelmingly in favor of Title II net neutrality protections, by more than 73 to 1. </b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="152" data-orig-width="750"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1a358f0e4292d6d7cc8ecb151144bf5b/tumblr_inline_ovi9hz2vks1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="152" data-orig-width="750"/></figure><p>So the telecom industry’s <b>own study</b> essentially shows what nearly <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/341850-poll-gop-voters-support-net-neutrality-rules-oppose-att-time-warner-merger" target="_blank">all</a> other <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/339137-poll-60-percent-of-voters-support-fccs-net-neutrality-rules" target="_blank">polling</a> on this issue <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/21/poll-shows-broad-bipartisan-support-net-neutrality-rules/" target="_blank">has shown</a>: that they are getting trounced when it comes to public opinion, and people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly agree that they don’t want their ISPs to have control over what they can see and do on the Internet. </p><p>The report also highlights that the data in the FCC docket is a mess. Fight for the Future has been working with a group of tech volunteers to analyze this data as well, and will be releasing our findings soon.</p><p>Much of the reporting on this study draws a false equivalence between real comments from real people gathered through grassroots activism campaigns with <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-13-update-historic-day-of-action-for-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">massive</a> public participation &ndash; and <a href="https://www.comcastroturf.com/" target="_blank">completely fraudulent comments</a> that use names and addresses from breached databases, or completely fake information. </p><p>Sadly, this confusion appears to be by design. Under Ajit Pai’s leadership, the FCC has repeatedly refused to address serious cybersecurity and transparency issues surrounding their public comment process, from the <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-08-07-breaking-former-fcc-security-employee-destroys/" target="_blank">now debunked</a> claims of DDoS attacks to the confirmed fraudulent comments that the agency won’t remove from its docket. </p><p>The agency is sabotaging the legitimacy of its own proceeding in a cynical attempt to spread confusion about something that is actually as clear as day: the majority of the voices calling for the end of net neutrality protections are those bought and paid for by the industry that stands to gain unprecedented control of our online experience if they succeed in rigging the game and gutting these consumer protections at the FCC or through bad legislation billed as a “compromise.”</p><p>###</p>
