      <h1><a href="/news/2015-08-04-fight-for-the-future-statement-on-introduction-of/">Fight for the Future statement on introduction of CISA cyber surveillance bill</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:13 EDT on August 4, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>August 3, 2015</p><p>Media contact:<br/>Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/><a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Yesterday evening, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ignored overwhelming public outcry against the government’s out of control spying programs and poor digital security and moved to advance debate on CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act.<br/></p><p>CISA is a surveillance bill masquerading as a “cybersecurity” bill. The world’s cybersecurity <a href="https://d1ovv0c9tw0h0c.cloudfront.net/files/2015/03/CISA-2015-Sign-On-Letter.pdf" target="_blank">experts agree</a> that CISA fails to even address the problem it claims to solve. It would do nothing to prevent high profile cyber attacks like the OPM hacks. In fact, by centralizing critical data amongst Federal agencies that have a proven track record of poor digital hygeine, CISA will make the United States even less safe from cyber attacks, while <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/249521-cisa-the-dirty-deal-between-google-and-the-nsa-that-no-one-is" target="_blank">dramatically expanding</a> the government’s unpopular mass surveillance capabilities.</p><p>Last week, Fight for the Future and a coalition of more than a dozen advocacy groups launched the campaign <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/125427075193/breaking-activists-announce-staggering-61" target="_blank">Operation: #FaxBigBrother</a>, to give Internet users a voice against CISA. The website <a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">FaxBigBrother.com</a> and the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FaxBigBrother&amp;src=tyah" target="_blank">#FaxBigBrother</a> quickly went viral generating more than 6.2 million faxes to Senate offices in a matter of days. </p><p><b>The following statement can be attributed to Fight for the Future campaign director, Evan Greer:</b></p><blockquote><p><i>“Congress has a penchant for pissing off the Internet, but they’ve really done it this time. Internet users are outraged that Mitch McConnell is rushing the Senate toward a bill that dramatically expands the government’s surveillance powers while making our networks even more vulnerable to the types of cyber attacks the government claims it’s trying to stop.</i></p><p><i>If we give Congress the benefit of the doubt that they’re pushing this fundamentally flawed bill out of ignorance rather than malice or corruption, their logic in pushing CISA as a solution to high profile cyber breaches like the OPM hacks is something like this: “Darn, we keep getting robbed. Let’s put a surveillance camera in the bathroom and keep leaving the front door unlocked.”</i></p><p><i>The manager’s amendment proposed does nothing to address the fundamentally flawed logic behind CISA. It’s clearly intended to appease privacy concerns with surface level changes while keeping keeping the most egregious parts of CISA intact.</i></p><p><i>Congress may be stuck in 1984, but Internet users won’t be fooled. There are already more than 6 million faxes on their way to Senate fax machines. Congress should expect the public outcry to grow ten fold if they move to a vote this week without proper debate and discussion about this extremely unpopular legislation.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future plans to escalate its activism against CISA in the coming days and encourages all Senators and Representatives who truly support the Constitution to oppose this dangerous and misguided legislation.</p><p>###</p><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights group best known for organizing massive online protests <a href="http://sopastrike.com" target="_blank">against SOPA</a> and for <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">net neutrality</a>. They were also behind <a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a>, the largest online campaign against mass surveillance, which was endorsed by Edward Snowden and thousands of tech companies.

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-07-30-breaking-activists-announce-staggering-61/">BREAKING: Activists announce staggering 6.1 million faxes to flood Senate offices in opposition to CISA</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:01 EDT on July 30, 2015</span>


        <figure data-orig-width="948" data-orig-height="534" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/bd524f420b188249229cf414b18cc669/tumblr_inline_nsaxhlp8071ri3xd7_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="948" data-orig-height="534"/></figure><p>Washington D.C. (July 30, 2015) &ndash; Advocates behind the viral campaign “Operation: <a href="http://faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">#FaxBigBrother</a>” today announced that concerned Internet users have generated more than 6.1 million facsimiles opposing S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA.) The faxes, sent because Congress is “stuck in 1984,”  will be constantly flooding into U.S. Senate offices in the coming days, encouraging members to vote against a bill that <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/2884-coalition-letter-from-55-civil-society-groups-security-experts-and-academics-opposing-cisa/Coalition%20Letter%20Strongly%20Opposing%20CISA.2bf07aabfc0241f4ae76cb4efe4fd31a.pdf" target="_blank">experts say</a> will fail to prevent cyber attacks like the OPM hacks and allow for exponentially more government surveillance.<br/></p><p>The faxed messages were generated by Internet users visiting two websites as part of a “Week of Action” against CISA: <a href="http://www.faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank"><b><a href="http://www.faxbigbrother.com" target="_blank">www.faxbigbrother.com</a></b></a> and <b><a href="http://www.stopcyberspying.com" target="_blank">www.stopcyberspying.com</a>,</b> using technology developed by Fight for the Future, which is currently running the entire operation out of their CTO Jeff Lyon’s attic. The fax blasting set-up involves a dedicated server and a dozen phone lines and modems capable of sending tens of thousands of faxes per day. (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/YgptY" target="_blank">See photos of the FaxRobot here.</a>)</p><p>“The Internet is clearly pissed off that Congress is trying to pass off a blatant surveillance bill as ‘cybersecurity’” said Tiffiniy Cheng, Co-Founder and Co-Director of Fight for the Future. “We’ve defeated information sharing bills like CISA over and over again. Congress should stop embarrassing themselves and listen to the experts who say we need better security, not more spying.”</p><p>Leadership previously made clear their intent to pass the bill before the summer work period. After intense opposition during the week of action, that is no longer certain.</p><p>“The Senate may be stuck in 1984, but we’ll make sure they get the message one way or another,” said Nathan White, senior legislative manager at Access. “If we are able to derail this bill it’s a big win for our right to privacy. Senate leadership made it clear that they intended to pass the bill before recess. The failure to do so, in the face of public opposition during the week of action, would be a clear failure for CISA.”</p><p>Also this week, a <a href="https://static.newamerica.org/attachments/2884-coalition-letter-from-55-civil-society-groups-security-experts-and-academics-opposing-cisa/Coalition%20Letter%20Strongly%20Opposing%20CISA.2bf07aabfc0241f4ae76cb4efe4fd31a.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> in opposition to CISA was signed by 68 organizations and security researchers, and dozens of groups have written blogs and public statements, collated at <a href="http://www.stopcyberspying.com" target="_blank">www.stopcyberspying.com</a>.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;With millions of faxes queued up to be sent to Congress, there is clearly an incredible amount of opposition to CISA. The Senate ought to take this sign into consideration when deciding on whether to proceed with CISA. Otherwise there&rsquo;s likely to be a paper shortage on the Hill shortly,&rdquo; said Ryan Hagemann, Civil Liberties Policy Analyst at the Niskanen Center.</p><p>&ldquo;Civil libertarians finally figured out that we needed to speak to Congress at their technical level &ndash; so we&rsquo;ve sent them 6 million faxes explaining why their cybersecurity ideas are antiquated and their lack of technological acumen so remarkably dangerous,&rdquo; stated Sascha Meinrath, Director of X-Lab.</p><p>The Operation: #FaxBigBrother week of action was organized by Fight for the Future, Access, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, with support from a dozen diverse privacy and civil liberties groups including the ACLU, American Library Association, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Constitution Project. Association of Research Libraries, Niskanen Center, Free Press, The X-Lab, Sunlight Foundation, and Media Alliance.</p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:44 EDT on July 28, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="384" data-orig-width="400"><img data-orig-height="384" data-orig-width="400" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ns7l8xxDME1s45cnp_540.jpg?1512060079974"/></figure><h2><b>This bill must be rejected by the Senate and President Obama should threaten to veto! <a href="https://www.faxbigbrother.com/" target="_blank">Take action here to #StopCISA</a></b><br/></h2><p><i>Cross-posted from <a href="http://www.congressionaldish.com/heres-how-cisa-helps-the-nsa-scrape-the-internet-backbone-to-read-your-emails-at-will/#more-1792" target="_blank">Congressional Dish</a>:</i><br/></p><p>The National Security Agency is sitting on a new surveillance 
apparatus, awaiting congressional action to help them begin collecting a
 massive amount of new data on people in the U.S. that they can view and
 share without a warrant.</p><p>According to<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/04/us/document-cyber-surveillance-documents.html" target="_blank"> documents</a>
 made available to the press by Edward Snowden, in 2012 the Department 
of Justice secretly approved the NSA to begin using cyber threat 
indicators as selector terms for conducting “upstream” surveillance, a 
technique that involves the use of interception equipment to pull 
information directly from the switches and cables that make up the 
Internet. It’s likely, however, that the NSA hasn’t had a lot of cyber 
threat information to work with up to this point; most of that 
information is held by private companies.</p><p>Now it appears that Congress may be ready to help the NSA get the 
information they need to finally crank up their cybersecurity 
surveillance system. The Senate this week is expected to take up a bill,
 the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754/text" target="_blank"> Cyber Information Sharing Act</a>
 (CISA, formerly known as CISPA), that would incentivize companies to liberally share “cyber 
threat indicators” with the Department of Homeland Security by granting 
them<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754/text#toc-idc6842ed051194cfda77e2d250867c1f7" target="_blank"> legal immunity</a> from any surveillance laws when they do so.</p><p>The companies would be allowed to leave their users’ personal details
 in the information they give to the government unless they 
affirmatively know that it is not directly related to a threat, and the 
DHS would be required to share all of the information with the NSA and 
other federal agencies.</p><p>But that’s just the beginning of how CISA would massively violate privacy.</p><p>Any information shared with the government under CISA could be<a href="http://webpolicy.org/2015/06/04/nsa-cybersecurity/#nsa_cybersecurity_fn_8" target="_blank"> used to turn on the NSA’s latent cybersecurity surveillance powers</a>.
 As revealed by the Snowden documents, cyber threat indicators can be 
used by the NSA as selectors to target the warrantless interception and 
collection of information from the Internet backbone. These selectors — 
things like email address, IP addresses, ranges of IP addresses, phone 
numbers, or strings of computer code — are used as filters to select and
 extract data from Internet traffic.</p><p>Importantly, any “incidental” data that is picked up along the way 
that is not directly related to the threat, including any and all 
personal data that is hacked or targeted as part of the cyber threat, 
can be indefinitely retained by the NSA. This could be a massive amount 
of data if a threat involves a company like Google, Bank of America, or 
AT&amp;T.</p><p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a" target="_blank">Section 702</a>
 of the FISA Amendments Act, which the government uses to authorize its 
upstream collection programs, allows the NSA to retain, share, and use 
information about U.S. persons related to criminal investigations, 
including (but not limited to) those involving cybersecurity crimes.</p><p>The NSA, FBI, and other law enforcement entities are allowed to query
 the databases that are assembled under Section 702 at will using U.S. 
persons identifiers (e.g. email addresses and phone numbers of people 
who live in the U.S.) to access communications that can be used in 
criminal investigations. This is the warrantless process that has become
 known as the “backdoor search loophole.” All of this can be done 
without a warrant under Section 702 because that law  was supposed to 
only be used to investigate foreign suspects.</p><p>There’s no way to know exactly how much CISA will expand the NSA’s 
ability to collect and query data on Americans’ communications, but the 
leaked documents suggest that the cyber threats shared under CISA will 
help them add a major new plank to their activities that they have 
lobbying for for years. The broad legal immunity provisions in CISA 
should help the NSA get a huge amount information to input into the 
system from a wide range of data-rich industries, including insurers, 
banks, casinos, telecoms, hospitals, airlines, and more that have 
already announced their<a href="http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/114-s-754/6636586/total-contributions" target="_blank"> support</a> for the bill.</p>

Why? So that the government can pressure these companies to share even more of our personal information with spy agencies like the NSA.<sup>2</sup></p><p>Congress has tried this before. Four times! Every time we’ve managed to defeat CISA-like legislation at the last minute. <b>This time, though, the prospects are looking grim.</b></p><p>Defense contractors and big banks are pouring money into lobbying and using recent news like the OPM hacks to spread fear and misinformation. Worse, President Obama is signaling that he’ll sign CISA if it ends up on his desk, even though security experts say it will do nothing to prevent cyber attacks.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Privacy groups have sent millions of emails and tens of thousands of phone calls to DC opposing this but they still aren’t listening. <b>We need to get creative.</b></p><p>So, since Congress seems to be stuck in 1984 and clearly doesn’t understand modern technology, we’re building a robot that can send them thousands upon thousands of&hellip; FAXES.</p><p><b>For every $5 that Fight for the Future members contribute, we can send 1,500 faxes to Congress from Internet users explaining why they oppose CISA!</b></p><p><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?=cisafax" target="_blank"><b>Click here to chip in $5 to bury Congress in faxes.</b></a></p><p>Congress doesn’t get a whole lot of faxes. If enough people chip in, we can break their all-time record and send Congress more faxes than they’ve ever seen before. Our action tool will make sending a fax as easy as signing a petition — and a lot more powerful. It’s going to be awesome.</p><p>The vote is going to be close.

Our goal is to overwhelm Congress with faxes, but we can only do it if enough people donate.</p><p><b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?=CISAfax" target="_blank">Click here to chip in whatever you can</a> </b>–– and look out for another email next week when we launch the fax attack to stop CISA in its tracks!</p><p>Thanks for all that you do,<br/>-Evan, Tiffiniy, Holmes, Jeff, Vasjen, Charlie, and Jessica<br/>Fight for the Future</p><p>P.S. I know you’re good at math, but just in case you were wondering: a $10 donation = 3,000 faxes! $50 = 15,000 faxes! $100 is 30,000 faxes!
