They’ve been lying to us for weeks about net neutrality, it’s very difficult to accept their claims about DDoS attacks when they have provided zero evidence to support them.”</p><p>The FCC also claims that they experienced a similar attack after Oliver’s segment on the issue in 2014. The agency has provided zero proof for either of these claims, in the face of the much more likely explanation: the FCC’s system is unprepared to handle large amounts of comments, and turned away tens of thousands of people trying to comment in support of net neutrality. </p><p>Gigi Sohn, a former senior staffer at the FCC, said “The official FCC position in 2014 was not that there was a DDoS attack following the John Oliver segment, because there was no clear evidence that such an attack occurred.” </p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><ul><li>The FCC’s servers <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/861962863245742084" target="_blank"><b>went down again</b></a> on Monday night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment re-aired on HBO.<br/><br/></li><li>They have continued to <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/862340597016821760" target="_blank"><b>show errors</b></a> this week. <br/><br/></li><li>Former FCC employees deny FCC CIO David Bray’s claim that the agency was hit with a DDoS attack after the John Oliver segment in 2014 and say there was never any evidence of such an attack (see above.)<br/><br/></li><li>The FCC’s servers were having a variety of problems and went down repeatedly as a result of net neutrality comments in the weeks leading up to the John Oliver segment on Monday. Emails from FCC employees sent to Fight for the Future confirm that they were having “server issues.”<br/><br/></li><li>In 2014 and 2015 the FCC’s website crashed several times under the weight of net neutrality comments from the public.<br/><br/></li><li>It can be difficult to distinguish a DDoS attack from a large amount of traffic coming from legitimately concerned citizens looking to file a comment.

        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, May 8, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><h2><i>Fight for the Future calls for the agency to release its logs to an independent analyst, guarantee that all comments will be counted</i></h2><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued a <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344764A1.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> claiming that it’s website was hacked with a DDoS attack at the exact same time that comments would have started flooding in from John Oliver’s viral Last Week Tonight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak" target="_blank">segment</a> about net neutrality on Sunday night. The media <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/john-oliver-tackles-net-neutrality-again-crashes-fcc-comments-site-again/" target="_blank">widely reported</a> that the surge in comments from the segment crashed the FCC’s site, which also happened several times during the massive grassroots mobilization that led to the current FCC rules in 2014 and 2015. </p><p>Fight for the Future, a leading digital rights group that has organized some of the largest actions in support of net neutrality, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to Campaign Director Evan Greer (pronouns: she/hers:)</p><blockquote><p><i>“The FCC’s statement today raises a lot of questions, and the agency should act immediately to ensure that voices of the public are not being silenced as it considers a move that would affect every single person that uses the Internet.</i></p><p><i>There are two possible scenarios and they are both concerning:</i></p><ol><li><i>The FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to access following John Oliver’s segment amounts to a “DDoS” attack, in order to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, or <br/><br/></i></li><li><i>Someone actually did DDoS the FCC’s site at the exact same time as John Oliver’s segment, in order to actively prevent people from commenting in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules that millions of people fought for in 2015.<br/></i></li></ol><p><i>Given Ajit Pai’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance" target="_blank">open hostility</a> toward net neutrality, and the telecom industry’s <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality" target="_blank">long history</a> of astroturfing and paying <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments" target="_blank">shady organizations</a> to do their dirty work, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet.</i></p><p><i>The FCC should immediately release its logs to an independent security analyst or major news outlet to verify exactly what happened last night. The public deserves to know, and the FCC has a responsibility to maintain a functioning website and ensure that every member of the public who wants to submit a comment about net neutrality has the ability to do so. Anything less is a subversion of our democracy.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Fight for the Future was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year.

BattleForTheNet.com has been the main online activism hub for the fight for net neutrality, which is the principle that internet traffic should be free from discrimination. Platforms including Boing Boing will also urge their users to support the campaign. </p><p><b>See the GoFundMe campaign and video here: <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/lets-save-net-neutrality-again" target="_blank">https://www.gofundme.com/lets-save-net-neutrality-again</a> </b></p><p>In 2014, as the big cable industry—one of the most politically entrenched and powerful lobbying forces in the world—continued its years-long push to end net neutrality, activists harnessed the power of the internet to fight back, and BattleForTheNet.com was a critical tool. Through these efforts, the online public won the FCC’s landmark 2015 Open Internet Order. As the new FCC commences its efforts to roll back protections, activists are making it clear that they will redouble their efforts to protect net neutrality. </p><p>BattleForTheNet.com has served as a crucial resource, informing the public and providing tools to contact policymakers in Washington. It served as the hub for the Internet Slowdown Day during which major sites like reddit, Netflix, Tumblr—and thousands of smaller sites—came together to drive more than one million emails and phone calls to the FCC and Congress. Ultimately, the grassroots support generated through BattleForTheNet.com helped ensure the Federal Communications Commission enacted the strongest net neutrality protections in history. </p><p>Now, with today’s announcement from FCC chair and former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai that he will seek to reverse the FCC’s decision to classify ISPs under Title II—a decision that provides the legal foundation for strong net neutrality —relaunching BattleForTheNet.com will be vital to organizing and preserving the net neutrality protections that activists, startups, companies and organizations from across the political spectrum have secured.</p><p>“Net neutrality advocates can’t match the lobbying dollars spent by the country’s cable monopolies and duopolies, but we clearly have the public on our side,” <b>said Demand Progress executive director David Segal.</b> “In recent years, millions have mobilized to stand up for an open internet, which is critical to our democracy. Now, with Chairman Pai announcing his intentions to roll back net neutrality protections, advocates will again use the internet to save the internet. BattleForTheNet.com will be the hub for the fight against Big Cable companies’ efforts to elevate their own profits over the public’s free speech — and we need the public’s support so we can compete with the cable lobby’s deep pockets.”</p><p>“When the Internet is under attack, we fight back,” <b>said Craig Aaron, president and CEO of Free Press. </b>“Pai’s move threatens to erase one of the most important victories for the public in the FCC’s history, to defang a needed watchdog, and to leave people everywhere at the mercy of the country’s most-hated phone and cable companies. We are banding together again with our allies to defend the Internet and to protect the rights of dissenting voices, social justice advocates, up-and-coming artists, and innovative businesses everywhere.”</p><p>&ldquo;The Internet, protected by the current net neutrality rules, has enabled the mothers of children killed by police to demand an end to police violence; it has enabled undocumented students to urge changes to our broken immigration system. It&rsquo;s provided the opportunity for new Black voices in the arts to bypass Hollywood gatekeepers. That&rsquo;s why we have so much to lose if Trump&rsquo;s FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, has his way. The only solution that protects the digital voice and rights of communities of color is vigorous enforcement of the rules we fought to get passed by the FCC two years ago. That&rsquo;s what we and our allies will continue to demand. There&rsquo;s too much at stake to accept anything less,“ <b>said the Center for Media Justice executive director Malkia Cyril. </b></p><p>“The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before. It’s the most powerful tool we have to expose corruption and hold governments and powerful institutions accountable,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b> “By attacking net neutrality, the basic free speech protections that have made the Internet what it is today, Team Cable’s puppet chairman Ajit Pai is not just threatening the future of the Internet, but the future of democracy and freedom of expression. Hell hath no fury like the Internet scorned. We’ll fight tooth and nail to defend net neutrality and keep the web free from censorship,” <b>she added.</b></p><p>“The internet has long been a key part of creative and civic life for immigrant communities like ours,” <b>said Cayden Mak, director of 18MillionRising.org. </b>“Gutting net neutrality protections fundamentally threatens the way that Asian American communities function. From helping us distribute our own music, movies, and art depicting our experiences, to keeping us connected to family and friends across the globe, a free and open internet has long helped Asian Americans understand who we are. We’re ready to fight again to defend free expression online.”</p><p>&quot;We need Battle for the Net and the organizations behind it now more than ever to ensure that the Trump FCC doesn’t kill the net neutrality rules. Their work was absolutely critical to getting the strongest-ever net neutrality rules in place in 2015 when I was at the FCC. Their ability to educate, energize and activate the general public will be the key to ensuring a free and open Internet&rdquo; <b>said Gigi Sohn, former counselor to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler.</b></p><p>&ldquo;Network discrimination is one of those issues that&rsquo;s wonky and boring enough that you&rsquo;d think it would slide past under the radar of public opinion, but it&rsquo;s so obviously egregious and terrible in every way that everyone who gets it is seized by inexhaustible fury, to the enduring surprise of dingo babysitters like Pai,” <b>said Cory Doctorow, of Boing Boing.</b></p>
