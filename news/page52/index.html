<p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>January 26, 2015</span></p>
<p><span>Contact: Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457</span><span><br/></span><span>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</span></p>
<p><strong>Net neutrality activists who organized the Internet Slowdown protest announce next campaign: the Internet Countdown, starting today</strong></p>
<p><em>Coalition behind BattleFortheNet.com call for websites and Internet users to join sustained “countdown” protest until FCC vote on February 26th</em></p>
<p><span>Exactly one month before the FCC’s presumed vote on Title II net neutrality rules, the digital rights groups behind the September 10th Internet Slowdown protest announced a new campaign today: the Internet Countdown.</span></p>
<p><strong>See the campaign landing page here: <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/countdown" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/countdown</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The Internet Countdown is a sustained effort where websites will display a countdown timer that literally counts down the seconds to the FCC vote on February 26th, and allows visitors to click to take action at <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank"><strong>BattleFortheNet.com</strong></a> in support of full net neutrality through Title II reclassification.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>The details of the protest were unveiled this morning, and the organizers plan to announce participants in a rolling fashion as they join the Internet Countdown effort. The first site to join after the announcement this morning </span><strong><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/01/26/1360138/-The-Internet-Countdown-to-real-net-neutrality-begins-today-With-us" target="_blank">was Daily Kos</a></strong><span>, which, with more than 8 million unique monthly visitors, is one of the largest progressive news sites on the web.</span></p>
<p><span>The Internet Countdown is being organized by </span><strong><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future,</a></strong><span> </span><strong><a href="http://demandprogress.org" target="_blank">Demand Progress</a></strong><span>, and <a href="http://freepress.net" target="_blank"><strong>Free Press</strong></a>, supported by the </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/#teaminternet" target="_blank">many of the groups</a></strong><span> involved with BattleFortheNet.com</span></p>
<p><span>In September, the same groups organized the </span><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/sept10th" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a></strong><span><strong>,</strong> an internet-wide uprising in support of Title II net neutrality that involved more than 40,000 websites including </span><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">many of the largest on the web</a></strong><span><strong>.</strong> The protest successfully drove more than 770,000 comments to the FCC and hundreds of thousands of phone calls to Congress in a single day.</span></p>
<p><span>“We are closer than ever to winning real net neutrality protections that will keep the Web open for generations to come, and the Internet is literally counting down the seconds,” </span><strong>said Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer,</strong><span> “We call on Internet users, cat video posters, music bloggers, youtube karaoke stars, and major websites to unite for one more epic push to make sure that the FCC does the right thing and that corrupt members Congress can’t derail the process.”</span></p>
<p><span>“This is it: All hands on deck for the open Internet,” </span><span><strong>said Demand Progress Executive Director David Segal.</strong> “</span><span>The ISPs are among the most hated companies in America, but they’re still loved by the politicians whose campaigns they back.  We know that they won’t relent in their opposition to net neutrality, and so we cannot relent in our active support for the cause, even as we feel optimistic about our chances.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Strong net neutrality protections are essential to the survival of Daily Kos and all independent media outlets. Without net neutrality, ISPs would be free to stifle or elevate voices based on their own corporate interests,” </span><strong>said Rachel Colyer, Senior Campaign Director at Daily Kos.</strong><span>”This is why we are part of the Internet Countdown—the FCC must do the right thing. We encourage our community to participate in the Democratic process by showing solidarity for strong net neutrality rules written at the FCC and based on Title II authority.”</span></p>
<p><span>“After close to a decade of fighting to save the Internet, we’re closer than ever to finally securing real Net Neutrality,” <strong>said Free Press President and CEO Craig Aaron.</strong> “Millions of people have called on Congress and the FCC to put the public need for an open Internet before the demands of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizon. Because of the passion and commitment of Internet users, the FCC seems poised to make new policies that will protect the public. But the industry lobbyists haven’t given up yet. And that’s why we must keep up the pressure in these crucial few weeks before a final vote.”</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 14:05 EST on January 21, 2015</span>


        <p><strong>UPDATE Jan 22 11:00am: </strong>Final tally for phone calls to Congress in response to yesterday&rsquo;s net neutrality hearings was more than 15,000. We averaged more than 1,500 calls per hour throughout the day.</p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nijjo9NsMd1ri3xd7.png?1512060080548"/></span></p>
<p><span><br/>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>January 22, 2015<br/><br/>Media contact: <br/>Evan Greer, 978-852-6457<br/>press@fightforthefuture.org<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Net neutrality activists drive thousands of phone calls to Congress during hearings: call for Title II reclassification, reject Thune-Upton proposal</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; Today as of 11:00am EST, the grassroots activists behind </span><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleFortheNet.com</a></strong><span> have driven </span><span>more than 15,000 phone calls to Congress, </span><span>bombarding the Hill </span><span>during House and Senate committee hearings to demand that Congress members allow the FCC to use their authority to enforce Title II net neutrality and reject the Thune-Upton Internet proposal. The page is currently still under heavy traffic, with thousands more phone calls expected in the coming hours.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>BattleForTheNet.com has been a centerpiece of the net neutrality movement since it served as the landing page for the Sept 10th </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank"><span>Internet Slowdown</span></a><span> protest. Today, the homepage featured an embedded livestream of the House and Senate hearings, with a click-to-call tool targeting the members the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee and the Senate Commerce Committee. Over the course of the day net neutrality supporters sent an average of 1,500 phone calls per hour to the House and Senate.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>“The Internet’s response today was swift and overwhelming,” </span><span><strong>said Fight for the Future’s Campaign Director Evan Greer</strong> </span><span>“As soon as we put the word out about the hearings in Congress, we were instantly inundated with traffic from thousands of people calling their lawmakers to say that net neutrality is not a partisan issue, and Congress should stay out of the way of real net neutrality protections through full Title II reclassification.”<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, added, </strong>&ldquo;The public understands that this legislative effort is a cynical sham, put forth by people and organizations that have repeatedly made it clear that they&rsquo;re shills for the big ISPs.  It&rsquo;s simple: if you support net neutrality, then you&rsquo;ll oppose the Thune-Upton proposal, and will let the FCC do its job.  Committee members will hear from tens of thousands of Americans this week, who will drive that point home.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Battle for the Net is supported by Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, Free Press, and </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#teaminternet" target="_blank"><span><strong>dozens of other</strong></span></a><span> advocacy groups and tech companies who support strong net neutrality protections through Title II reclassification.</span></p>
<p><br/><span>###<br/></span></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-11681670-0d75-b8c6-715c-a33064021488"><span>We’ll keep this brief. Comcast is in attack mode, right now. We need you to fight back.</span></p>
<p><span>Team Cable’s allies in Congress are advancing two bills that would overrule the FCC and kill our dream for real net neutrality [1]. </span><span>Hearings are happening TODAY, at this very moment.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Click here to call the committee members, right now and tell them to stop standing in the way of real net neutrality. We need *everyone* to do this.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>This was Comcast’s big play all along: if they lose the FCC, get Congress to do the dirty work. Now it’s happening. There are two </span><span>fake</span><span> net neutrality bills in motion that </span><span>wouldn’t</span><span> stop cable companies from discriminating against certain sites, but </span><span>would</span><span> block the FCC from enforcing real rules.</span></p>
<p><span>Hearings run all day. The House hearings start at 10am, and the Senate at 2pm.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">How awesome would it be if while they’re at these bogus hearings, they get panicked texts from staff about the HUGE number of pro-net neutrality calls? That’s what we’re shooting for. Can you call now?</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, since there’s really a lot of calls to make, we’re trying something special. if you call all 10 targets, the 11th call goes to my personal cell phone, where I’ll thank you personally. </span></p>
<p><span>Will you do it? If so, talk to you soon! :)</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>Holmes Wilson (and the entire team)<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S.</span><span> If you’re interested, we’re live streaming the hearings at </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">battleforthenet.com</a></strong><span> all day. Watch them, and dig in on Twitter.</span></p>

<p><strong>Internet freedom activists unfurl banner in front of Senator Ron Wyden at town hall event: “Don’t Betray the Internet! No Fast Track for the TPP!”</strong></p>
<p><span>Grants Pass, OR&ndash; Today, activists working in coordination with digital rights group Fight for the Future briefly disrupted a town hall meeting hosted by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden when they unfurled a banner behind the Senator reading, </span><span>“Senator Wyden: Don’t Betray the Internet! No Fast Track for the TPP!”</span></p>
<p><strong>Click here to see photos of the action: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/FOMuS" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/FOMuS</a></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The activists are joining tens of thousands of voices who have called upon Senator Wyden to oppose outdated and undemocratic “Fast Track” legislation, also known as “Trade Promotion Authority,” as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive, secretive trade deal that has been condemned by advocacy organizations from across the political spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span>“Senator Wyden has long been considered a champion of Internet freedom, which is why it’s unthinkable that he’s pushing for outdated Fast Track legislation, which could have dire consequences for the future of the free and open web,” s</span><span>aid Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.</span><span> “Senator Wyden now has a choice: he can be remembered as the hero who stuck to his principles and defended the Internet, or as the traitor who allowed DC politics and corporate interests to poison the web with censorship.”</span></p>
<p><span>While activists on the ground in Oregon brought their message directly to Senator Wyden, thousands more </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/ronwyden" target="_blank"><span>took action online</span></a><span>, tweeting, calling, and emailing the Senator to ask him to oppose Fast Track legislation and stand up for the free and open Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Previously, Fight for the Future, Oregon Fair Trade Campaign, and other groups sent Senator Wyden </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wyden/" target="_blank"><span>thousands of floppy discs </span></a><span>as part of a campaign calling for him to oppose Fast Track legislation. The Senator also </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/letter/" target="_blank"><span>received an open letter</span></a><span> signed by more than 25 tech companies, asking him to oppose such legislation.</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:08 EST on January 14, 2015</span>


        <div>
<p><span><strong><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ni6qo8QAHQ1ri3xd7.jpg?1512060080548"/></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>A Ringing Endorsement for For Net Neutrality: Reddit, Activism Orgs To Drive Thousands of Phone Calls To Congress</span></strong></span></p>
<p><em>Effort marks one-year anniversary of court decision undermining Net Neutrality rules</em></p>
<p><span>Washington D.C. (<span><span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_121786234"><span class="aQJ">January 14, 2015</span></span></span></span>) – Members of Congress should expect to hear from tens of thousands of constituents in the coming days as Internet users rise up once again in support of strong Net Neutrality rules. The calls are being organized by Demand Progress, Fight For The Future, Free Press Action Fund, and reddit. The effort is hosted at <a href="http://nathanwhite.cmail2.com/t/t-l-trdykdd-zudkljrl-z/" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a>, a hub site for Net Neutrality activists, and marks the anniversary of a court decision striking down net neutrality rules that were promulgated under an inappropriate authority.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC is expected to issue a new Net Neutrality rule on <span><span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_121786235"><span class="aQJ">February 26th</span></span></span></span>. Constituent input to Congress is critical, as Congress may or may not attempt to overturn the FCC’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span>By visiting <a href="http://nathanwhite.cmail2.com/t/t-l-trdykdd-zudkljrl-v/" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a> and entering just their phone number and zip code, users will receive an automated call connecting them to both their senators and their representative.</span></p>
<p><span>Reddit, which receives more than 170 million unique visitors each month, will use space on its front page to promote the effort.</span></p>
<p><span>Calls will be placed to Congress all day long, but those who call Congress after <span><span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_121786236"><span class="aQJ">3pm</span></span></span></span> Eastern will then be connected to reddit co-founder and executive chair Alexis Ohanian. Mr. Ohanian will be broadcast live on reddit so that users can watch as he frenetically thanks as many Internet users as possible for standing up for Net Neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span>“The Internet is driving the new digital economy, but legacy corporations would like to stifle that innovation. </span><span>Steve Huffman &amp; I were very fortunate in starting reddit, so I&rsquo;m honored to spend a day thanking the Internet users who are fighting to save Net Neutrality for the next generation of tech entrepreneurs</span><span>,” said Alexis Ohanian.</span></p>
<p><span>“Too often in Washington, well-heeled lobbyists get their way simply because the rules are too arcane for the average person to follow. That simply isn&rsquo;t the case with the Internet. The future of the Internet is too important to sell off to the highest bidder,” said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress.</span></p>
<p><span>“Brace yourself, Congress. The Internet is coming,” said Evan Greer, campaign director at Fight For The Future.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for members of Congress to either get on the right side of the Net Neutrality issue or get out of the way,&rdquo; said Free Press Action Fund President and CEO Craig Aaron. &ldquo;Millions of Americans have spoken out, and the FCC is poised to give us the real Net Neutrality rules we need. Congress has already put in place the bipartisan legal framework that would make this a reality. The FCC now just needs to act by reclassifying Internet access under Title II.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Net Neutrality is the fundamental principle of the Internet that treats all web traffic equally. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) must treat the small amount of traffic necessary to check an email the same as traffic necessary to stream video. If Net Neutrality didn&rsquo;t exist, ISPs would be free to change the speed at which you can access certain content to extract profit, or block it all together.</span></p>
<p><span>Verizon sued the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), arguing that the FCC’s 2010 rules were promulgated under an faulty authority. A court agreed exactly one year ago today.</span></p>
<p><span>While corporations like Verizon and Comcast see extra profits to be had by selling priority access to their consumers, Internet users have demanded that the FCC simply reclassify broadband Internet and keep similar rules to those that have always governed the Internet.
