However, the Army is continuing to threaten Chelsea with solitary confinement for charges directly related to her attempt to take her own life, even though it was the government’s own mistreatment of Chelsea that drove her to it.  </p><p>Supporters have launched a new effort at <a href="http://freechelsea.com" target="_blank">FreeChelsea.com</a> calling for the charges to be dropped. The site features a petition to the Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning as well as videos uploaded by supporters including Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. </p><p>Chelsea alerted attorneys and supporters that she was ending the hunger strike after government officials showed her a memo stating that she will receive gender-reassignment surgery, under the DOD’s <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/features/2016/0616_policy/DoD-Instruction-1300.28.pdf" target="_blank">new policy</a> affecting transgender service members. If this occurs, Manning will be the first transgender prisoner in the U.S. to receive this medically recommended treatment, setting a precedent that could benefit thousands of transgender prisoner.</p><p>“I am unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right thing. I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted – for them to let me be me,” said Chelsea Manning in a statement to her attorneys. “But it is hard not to wonder why it has taken so long.  Also, why were such drastic measures needed? The surgery was recommended back in April 2016. The recommendations for my hair length were back in 2014. In any case, I hope this sets a precedent for the thousands of trans people behind me hoping they will be given the treatment they need.”</p><p>“It is a relief to hear that the government has finally agreed to move forward with providing Chelsea with the health care that she is legally entitled to and is medically needed. We hope that they will act to provide this care without delay in order to ensure that her suffering does not continue,” said Chase Strangio, Chelsea’s attorney at the ACLU, “This medical care is absolutely vital for Chelsea. It was the government’s refusal to provide her with the necessary care that led her to attempt suicide earlier this year, and it was all the more troubling when she became subject to an investigation and possible punishment in connection with the suicide attempt. We hope that the government recognizes that charging Chelsea with the crime of being denied essential health care is outrageous and drops those charges.”</p><p>“Hundreds of thousands of people spoke out in support of Chelsea, and now the government is finally agreeing to provide her with the healthcare treatment that she needs,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, the digital rights group behind FreeChelsea.com that has supported Chelsea over the last year, “but now that the Army is acknowledging Chelsea deserves this treatment, it’s even more outrageous that they’re still threatening her with solitary confinement for charges related to her own suicide attempt. It was the government’s refusal to grant Chelsea access to needed health care that led to her suicide attempt in the first place.”</p><p>Chelsea’s supporters plan to release more videos to raise awareness about the new petition at FreeChelsea.com in the coming days.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FeYrhdUcfClE"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYrhdUcfClE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>###</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-09-09-chelsea-manning-begins-hunger-strike-to-protest/">Chelsea Manning Begins Hunger Strike to Protest Bullying by Prison and US Government</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:21 EDT on September 9, 2016</span>


        <p><b>For Immediate Release</b>: September 9, 2016<br/><b>Contact</b>: Christina DiPasquale, <a href="mailto:press@balestramedia.com" target="_blank">press@balestramedia.com</a></p><p>UPDATE: Fight for the Future has launched a petition supporting Chelsea in her hunger strike. <b><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/stand-with-chelsea-manning-on-hunger-strike" target="_blank">See the petition here. </a></b></p><p>Today, after years of requesting the care she needs for gender dysphoria, Chelsea Manning has released a statement about the start of her hunger strike.</p><p>Chelsea is demanding written assurances from the Army she will receive all of the medically prescribed recommendations for her gender dysphoria and that the “high tech bullying” will stop. “High tech bullying,” is what Chelsea describes as “the constant, deliberate and overzealous administrative scrutiny by prison and military officials.”</p><p>Following her sentencing, Chelsea has respectfully requested that the US Government give her treatment for her gender dysphoria. Over a year later, Chelsea filed a lawsuit in September of 2014, where she sued the government to get a battery of treatments. As a result, she began hormone therapy in February of 2015.<br/><br/>However, the military has been making her cut her hair to the male length and grooming standards. As part of her treatment, her doctors recommended that she follow the military prison&rsquo;s female hair grooming standards. In September of 2015 she amended her lawsuit, asking that the government allow her to grow her hair. The government’s response in December 2015 was &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The case is still active before a DC District court judge.</p><p><b>Statement from Chelsea Manning:</b></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I need help. I am not getting any. I have asked for help time and time again for six years and through five separate confinement locations. My request has only been ignored, delayed, mocked, given trinkets and lip service by the prison, the military, and this administration.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need help. I needed help earlier this year. I was driven to suicide by the lack of care for my gender dysphoria that I have been desperate for. I didn&rsquo;t get any. I still haven&rsquo;t gotten any.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I needed help. Yet, instead I am now being punished for surviving my attempt. When I was a child, my father would beat me repeatedly for simply not being masculine enough. I was told to stop crying—to &quot;suck it up.&rdquo; But, I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying. The pain just got worse and worse. Until finally, I just couldn&rsquo;t take the pain anymore.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;I needed help, but no one came then. No one is coming now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Today, I have decided that I am no longer going to be bullied by this prison—or by anyone within the U.S. government. I have asked for nothing but the dignity and respect—that I once actually believed would be provided for—afforded to any living human being.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not believe that this should be dependent on any arbitrary factors—whether you are cisgender or transgender; service member or civilian, citizen or non-citizen. In response to virtually every request, I have been granted limited, if any, dignity and respect—just more pain and anguish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am no longer asking. Now, I am demanding. As of 12:01 am Central Daylight Time on September 9, 2016, and until I am given minimum standards of dignity, respect, and humanity, I shall—refuse to voluntarily cut or shorten my hair in any way; consume any food or drink voluntarily, except for water and currently prescribed medications; and comply with all rules, regulations, laws, and orders that are not related to the two things I have mentioned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is a peaceful act. I intend to keep it as peaceful and non-violent, on my end, as possible. Any physical harm that should come to me at the hands of military or civilian staff will be unnecessary and vindictive. I will not physically resist or in any way harm another person. I have also submitted a &quot;do not resuscitate&rdquo; letter that is effective immediately. This shall include any attempts to forcibly cut or shorten my hair or to forcibly feed me by any medical or pseudo-medical means.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;Until I am shown dignity and respect as a human again, I shall endure this pain before me. I am prepared for this mentally and emotionally. I expect that this ordeal will last for a long time. Quite possibly until my permanent incapacitation or death. I am ready for this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need help. Please, give me help.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>###</p>
