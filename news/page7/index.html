        <span class="date">Posted 11:25 EDT on June 13, 2017</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="566" data-orig-width="862"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/125308742cc3f6ee4d4cef31c3be3ae8/tumblr_inline_orlvg8ysgw1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="566" data-orig-width="862"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, June 13, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2>Amazon, Netflix, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, Reddit, OK Cupid, PornHub, Imgur, Internet Association, Vimeo, GitHub, among sites participating in online protest</h2><p>Momentum is building for an “Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality” scheduled for July 12th to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal framework for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation.</p><p>The diverse list of companies and organizations supporting the effort has continued to grow with a slew of major players joining including the<b> OK Cupid, Netflix,</b> the <b>Internet Association,</b> <b>Imgur</b>, <b>Sonic </b>(an ISP), popular domain registrar <b>Namecheap</b>, <b>Writers Guild West</b>, <b>Fark</b>, <b>O’Reilly Media</b>, <b>DuckDuckGo</b>, <b>Checkout.com</b>, <b>Chess.com</b> (the world’s most popular online chess site), hip music blog <b>Consequence of Sound</b>, and venture capital firm <b>Union Square Ventures</b>. More than 30,000 people, sites, and organizations have signed up to participate in the effort overall, and more announcements from major companies are expected in the coming days. Many popular online personalities including YouTuber <a href="https://twitter.com/PhillyD/status/872200755020578816" target="_blank"><b>Philip DeFranco</b></a> have also announced their participation.</p><p><b>See the announcement for the day of action here: <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/july12</a>  </b></p><p>The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the Internet Slowdown. The day of action will focus on grassroots mobilization, with public interest groups activating their members and major web platforms providing their visitors with tools to contact Congress and the FCC.</p><p>Companies participating include Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Reddit, Mozilla, Vimeo, Y Combinator, GitHub, Private Internet Access, Pantheon, Bittorrent Inc., Shapeways, Nextdoor, Patreon, Dreamhost, and CREDO Mobile, Goldenfrog, Fark, Chess.com, Imgur, Namecheap, DuckDuckGo, Checkout.com, Sonic, Brave, Ting, ProtonMail, O’Reilly Media, Discourse, and Union Square Ventures. Organizations participating include Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, Demand Progress, Center for Media Justice, EFF,  Internet Association,  Internet Archive, World Wide Web Foundation, Creative Commons, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Greenpeace, Common Cause, ACLU, Rock the Vote, American Library Association, Daily Kos, OpenMedia, The Nation, PCCC, MoveOn, OFA, Public Knowledge, OTI, Color of Change, MoveOn, Internet Creators Guild, and many others.</p><p><b>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said:</b> “The Internet has given more people a voice than ever before, and we’re not going to let the FCC take that power away from us. Massive online mobilization got us the strong net neutrality protections that we have now, and we intend to fight tooth and nail to defend them. Politicians in Washington, DC need to learn that net neutrality is not a partisan issue and Internet users will not tolerate these attacks on our basic rights &ndash; we will come together to protect the web as an open platform for free expression and exchange of ideas.”</p><p><b>Michal Rosenn, General Counsel at Kickstarter, said: </b>“A threat to net neutrality is a threat to the free exchange of ideas that creative culture and an informed public rely upon. Kickstarter, and the tens of thousands of creators who have brought new ideas to life through our platform, all depend on a free and open internet. We&rsquo;re proud to stand alongside so many others today to preserve net neutrality, and to protect the freedoms that make the internet such a powerful force.”</p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director at the Center for Media Justice, said: </b>&ldquo;Communities of color across the United States depend on an open Internet to thrive. From resisting police violence to demanding fair wages &ndash; the political voice and economic opportunity that the Internet enables must remain protected by Title II net neutrality. Trump&rsquo;s FCC seeks to wall these communities off from the power of the internet as a mobilizing tool and an equalizer. On July 12, we will stand together with activists, Internet users of color, advocacy groups, and tech companies to preserve democracy by defending our Internet.”</p><p><b>Michael Cheah, General Counsel, Vimeo, said:</b> “Net neutrality made it possible for Vimeo, along with countless other startups, to innovate and thrive. The FCC’s proposed rollback of the 2015 open Internet rules threatens to impede that innovation and allow a handful of incumbent ISPs to determine winners and losers. On July 11th, Vimeo will proudly join our fellow tech brethren to rally Internet users nationwide to demand strong net neutrality rules to prevent ISPs from manipulating Internet traffic.”</p><p><b>Mark Stanley, communications director of Demand Progress, said: </b>“The FCC&rsquo;s plan to dismantle net neutrality will unfairly pad the bottom lines of Comcast and the rest of Big Cable, while undermining the public’s ability to freely communicate, organize, and innovate. Every few years, a threat so severe confronts the open internet that people, organizations, and companies from across the political spectrum—including some of the largest online platforms—must band together in common cause to fight back. The FCC’s ongoing effort to roll back net neutrality protections represents just such a threat — and on the July 12th day of action, we’ll once again use the transformative power of the internet to defend the internet itself.”</p><p><b>Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator, said: </b>&quot;At Y Combinator, the startup accelerator I run, we have proudly supported thousands of entrepreneurs and more than 1,400 businesses, including companies like AirBnB and Dropbox. Companies like these have gone on to change our lives for the better—how we work, how we eat, how we live. They could grow and compete, and ultimately consumers choose who wins and loses online. Without strong net neutrality rules, though, I’m concerned that the cable and wireless companies that control internet access will have outsized power to pick winners and losers in the market.&rdquo;<br/></p><p><b>Free Press Campaign Director Candace Clement said:</b> “It’s like déjà vu. The last time Net Neutrality came before the FCC, internet users across the political spectrum swamped the agency with comments demanding strong Net Neutrality protections. The internet won’t go down quietly in 2017 and on July 12 people, companies, organizations and websites will let everyone know that the Trump FCC lacks a public mandate to take away our online rights. We will make it impossible for Chairman Pai to continue to cling to the sorts of alternative facts against Net Neutrality that we’ve proven to be wrong time and again.”</p><p><b>Denelle Dixon, Mozilla&rsquo;s Chief Legal and Business Officer, said:</b> &ldquo;Net neutrality is vital to a healthy Internet: it protects free speech, competition and innovation online. It&rsquo;s also something a majority of Americans support — 76%, according to a recent Mozilla-Ipsos poll. By reverting to a Title I classification for ISPs, the FCC is endangering Americans&rsquo; access to a free and open web. The FCC is creating an Internet that benefits ISPs, not users.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Zachary Rosen, CEO of Pantheon, said:</b> &ldquo;We started Pantheon to make it easier for organizations big and small to succeed on the Web. But if strong net neutrality rules under Title II go away, it&rsquo;d put both us and our customers&rsquo; innovation at risk.” </p><p>###</p>

Further, we encourage journalists to ask ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T whether they are funding this activity, or providing funding for groups that could be engaging in this activity.</p><p>###</p><p>[1]<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/</a> </p><p>[2] <a href="https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc</a> <br/>[3]<a href="http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/" target="_blank">http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/</a> [4]<a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead</a></p><p>[5] <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/05/26/victims-demand-fcc-remove-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/#1ffbf336e793" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/05/26/victims-demand-fcc-remove-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/#1ffbf336e793</a> </p>

(Separately, Fight for the Future <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-23-comcast-tries-to-censor-pro-net-neutrality-website/" target="_blank"><b>also received</b></a> a baseless “Cease and Desist” letter from Comcast attempting to censor Comcastroturf.com)</p><p> Three separate reports came from friends of recently-deceased individuals who confirmed their friends could not have posted the comments posthumously.  </p><p> “In my nearly 30 years of being an Internet user, I&rsquo;ve been extremely judicious about using my real name online. On those rare times when I have chosen to do so, it&rsquo;s been for something I feel strongly about. To see my good name used to present an opinion diametrically opposed to my own view on Net Neutrality makes me feel sad and violated,” <b>Joel Mullaney told Fight for the Future. </b>“Whoever did this violated one of the most basic norms of our democratic society, that each of us have our own voice, and I am eager to know from what source the FCC obtained this falsified affidavit. I have been slandered,”<b> Mr. Mullaney added.</b></p><p> Although much evidence of this identity theft has been documented by concerned citizens, experts, media outlets, and organizations like Fight for the Future, [1][2][3][4] Chairman Pai and the FCC have taken no steps to remove them from the docket, risking the safety and privacy of potentially hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p> The letter to Chairman Pai calls for the FCC to take the following actions: “[1] Notify all who have been impacted by this attack, [2] remove all of the fraudulent comments, including the ones made in our names, from the public docket immediately, [3] publicly disclose any information the FCC may have about the group or person behind the 450,000+ fake comments, and [4] call for an investigation by the appropriate authorities into possible violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (“Making false statements”) and other relevant laws.”</p><p> “There is significant evidence that a person or organization has been using stolen names and addresses to fraudulently file comments opposing net neutrality,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. “For the FCC’s process to have any legitimacy, they simply cannot move forward until an investigation has been conducted. We need to know who is doing this,” she added.</p><p> Fight for the Future encourages journalists to investigate this situation, and is calling for the FCC to disclose any information it has pertaining to the person or organization behind this attack. Further, we encourage journalists to ask ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T whether they are funding this activity, or providing funding for groups that could be engaging in this activity.</p><p>Fight for the Future is asking for all victims of this attack to email them with a report: <a href="mailto:team@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">team@fightforthefuture.org</a><br/></p><p>###</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/dhxyjwg/</a><br/></p><p>[2] <a href="https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@csinchok/an-analysis-of-the-anti-title-ii-bots-463f184829bc</a> </p><p>[3] <a href="http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/" target="_blank">http://kdvr.com/2017/05/14/7000-coloradans-names-addresses-used-to-post-fake-comments-about-government-decision/</a> </p><p>[4] <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/160807353428/fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead</a> </p>

        <span class="date">Posted 10:40 EDT on May 25, 2017</span>


        <p>May 25, 2017<br/>The Honorable Ajit Pai<br/>Chairman<br/>Federal Communications Commission<br/>445 12th Street, S.W.<br/>Washington, D.C. 20554 </p><p>Dr. David A.

Whoever is behind this stole our names and addresses, publicly exposed our private information without our permission, and used our identities to file a political statement we did not sign onto. Hundreds of thousands of other Americans may have been victimized too. </p><p><b>We call on you, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to take the following actions:</b></p><ul><li>Notify all who have been impacted by this attack</li><li>Remove all of the fraudulent comments, including the ones made in our names, from the public docket immediately</li><li>Publicly disclose any information the FCC may have about the group or person behind the 450,000+ fake comments</li><li>Call for an investigation by the appropriate authorities into possible violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (“making false statements”) and other relevant laws.</li></ul><p> As chairman of the FCC, an independent federal agency, it is your responsibility to maintain public trust, especially while your agency is fielding comments on the future of the free and open Internet, an issue that millions of Americans care deeply about.</p><p>Based on numerous media reports [2], nearly half a million Americans may have been impacted by whoever impersonated us in a dishonest and deceitful campaign to manufacture false support for your plan to repeal net neutrality protections.</p><p>While it may be convenient for you to ignore this, given that it was done in an attempt to support your position, it cannot be the case that the FCC moves forward on such a major public debate without properly investigating this known attack.<br/></p><p>All proper authorities must be notified immediately and the FCC must disclose any and all information the agency has pertaining to the organization or person behind these fake comments.<br/></p><p><b>Sincerely, </b></p><p>Brittany Ainsworth, Huntington Beach, CA<br/>Greg Baynes, View Park, CA,<br/>William Brahams, San Bernardino, CA<br/>Christian Brown, Redondo Beach, CA<br/>John Burr, New York, NY<br/>Angelica Collins, Bear, DE<br/>Megan Conschafter, Buffalo, NY<br/>Ben Currier, Littleton, CO<br/>Norman Daoust, Cambridge, MA<br/>Cynthia Duby, Desert Hot Springs, CA<br/>Aaron Francis, Santa Ana, CA<br/>Michelle Ellett, Benicia, CA<br/>Adam Galatioto, Gainesville, FL<br/>Surbhi Godsay, Nashua, NH<br/>Daniel Hickey, Worcester, MA<br/>Richard O.
