The petitions call for the military to provide Chelsea with adequate and humane treatment for both her gender dysphoria and her suicide attempt.  </p><p><b>See more photos of the petition delivery below.</b></p><p><b>On a press call following the delivery, Chelsea’s attorney at the ACLU, Chase Strangio, said:</b> “Chelsea&rsquo;s access to mental health care has been inconsistent. It is an ongoing concern of her attorneys and supporters that she is not getting adequate mental health care, particularly in light of the external forces that are destabilizing her mental health, like the service of these administrative charges against her and the ongoing investigation of those charges. It seems like the government is doing everything in their power to make her physical and mental condition worsen. Punishment for these charges could not only result in significant punishment, including indefinite solitary confinement, but also loss of access to the very things that connect Chelsea&rsquo;s voice with the world.”</p><p><b>Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, said,</b> “No harm has resulted from Chelsea Manning&rsquo;s disclosures. Not giving her the proper medical treatment and then adding on these charges for her suicide attempt would seem designed to break her down as a human being. These charges appear to me to be sadistic and outrageous.”</p><p>Ms. Manning attempted to take her own life in July after years of mistreatment in prison, and now the U.S. government is threatening to punish her further with serious <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-07-28-chelsea-manning-faces-new-charges-indefinite/" target="_blank">new charges</a> directly related to her suicide attempt, which could lead to her being placed in indefinite solitary confinement, among other consequences.

Celebrities including John Cusack, Pamela Anderson, Wil Wheaton, Margaret Cho, Sean Ono Lennon, weigh in</i></h2><p>In just a matter of days, tens of thousands of people have expressed their outrage through a petition at <a href="http://freechelsea.com" target="_blank"><b>FreeChelsea.com</b></a> after it was reported that the U.S. Army is threatening imprisoned whistleblower Chelsea Manning with indefinite solitary confinement and serious <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-07-28-chelsea-manning-faces-new-charges-indefinite/" target="_blank"><b>new charges</b></a> directly related to a July 5th attempt to take her own life, following years of mistreatment while incarcerated.</p><p>More than 20,000 people have already added their names, with more signatures streaming in every hour. <a href="http://freechelsea.com" target="_blank"><b>The petition</b></a> is addressed to the Secretary of the Army, Eric Fanning, and reads: “Punishing Chelsea Manning for attempting to take her own life after systemic mistreatment is inhumane. Drop these new charges, and immediately give Chelsea access to adequate health care.” The page has spread quickly on social media, with celebrities like<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/johncusack/status/759889431696384001" target="_blank">John Cusack</a></b>,<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/pamfoundation/status/759047276455161856" target="_blank">Pamela Anderson</a></b>,<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/margaretcho/status/759243674387701760" target="_blank">Margaret Cho</a></b>,<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/seanonolennon/status/759441650640748545" target="_blank">Sean Ono Lennon</a></b>,<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/wilw/status/759171617347874816" target="_blank">Wil Wheaton</a></b>, and Rage Against the Machine guitarist <a href="https://twitter.com/tmorello/status/760175996041658368" target="_blank"><b>Tom Morello</b></a>, expressing their support for Chelsea.</p><p>The effort was launched by digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future, who have supported well-known transparency advocate Manning in the past, including through a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/chelsea-manning-supporters-deliver-petition-drop-charges" target="_blank"><b>petition effort</b></a> last year that successfully <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/127036786593/breaking-chelsea-manning-found-guilty-punished" target="_blank"><b>kept her out</b></a> of solitary confinement when she was facing similarly outrageous charges for “infractions” that included possession of LGBTQ reading material and an expired tube of toothpaste. They also organized supporters <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/135448091208/whistleblower-chelsea-manning-to-receive-5000" target="_blank">to send </a>her </b>more than 5,000 birthday cards last year. </p><p>“Our message could not be more simple: Chelsea Manning is a human being and deserves basic human dignity and fair treatment,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, who speaks to Chelsea on a regular basis,</b> “threatening her with further abuse and punishment immediately following her attempt to take her own life is cruel and inhumane, and appears to be part of an ongoing attempt by the Army to silence Chelsea’s important voice as an advocate for transparency and government accountability.”</p><p>Signatures are still streaming in to the petition effort, which Fight for the Future plans to deliver to the Secretary of the Army in the coming days.
