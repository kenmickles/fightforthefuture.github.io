        <span class="date">Posted 15:26 EDT on July 18, 2017</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, July 18, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>This morning Fight for the Future <b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-18-net-neutrality-activists-set-sights-on-congress/" target="_blank">announced</a> </b>plans to put up crowdfunded billboards focused on members of Congress who oppose net neutrality protections.<br/></p><p>Rep Scalise’s name was incorrectly included in private emails to two reporters, due to a copy paste error, and reported by Politico. This error was immediately corrected once brought to our attention, and we regret the confusion it caused. We would obviously not run billboards against someone who is in the hospital, and wish Rep Scalise a speedy recovery.</p><p>As for the billboards focused on other members, Congress plays an important role overseeing the FCC, and voters deserve to know where their members stand. The goal of our billboards is to make sure that the public knows which members are supporting the FCC’s plan to dismantle important net neutrality protections.</p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 08:57 EDT on July 18, 2017</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2536" data-orig-width="3944"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/d1e644ec92f4901d0f4bb5bd3488fd6d/tumblr_inline_otaelbVFXH1ri3xd7_540.jpg" data-orig-height="2536" data-orig-width="3944"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, July 18, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>July 12 protest drove record numbers of comments, emails, and phone calls</i></h2><p>Digital rights group Fight for the Future unveiled today the next steps in the battle for the future of the Internet: turning the focus on Congress &ndash; who have oversight over the FCC and whose actions will determine whether Ajit Pai’s unpopular plan moves forward &ndash; with a wave of <b><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/nnbillboards/#page-1" target="_blank">crowdfunded billboards</a> </b>and a <b><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard" target="_blank">“congressional scorecard”</a> </b>on BattleForTheNet.com showing where lawmakers stand. </p><p>The group has already raised more than $50,000 toward the billboards, which will go up in the coming weeks targeting lawmakers who support FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to gut net neutrality rules that prevent companies like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon from charging extra fees, slowing down websites, and engaging in censorship. The congressional scorecard makes it easy for voters to quickly learn their representative’s positions, and impossible for members of Congress to hide from their constituents. </p><p><b>See the crowdfunding page for the billboards here: <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/nnbillboards/#page-1" target="_blank">https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/nnbillboards/#page-1</a> </b></p><p><b>See the congressional scorecard here: <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard" target="_blank">https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard</a></b> </p><p>“Internet users are pissed off and paying attention,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“Any lawmaker that stands idly by and allows the FCC to gut these basic free speech protections that people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly support will be seen as an enemy of the Internet and an enemy of free speech. These billboards, and the scorecard, are just the beginning.” </p><p>The group plans to initially put up billboards targeting House GOP leadership members who used a meeting last week <b><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/341867-house-republican-leadership-cautions-tech-on-net-neutrality-report" target="_blank">to threaten</a> </b>tech companies who were participating in the historic net neutrality day of action on July 12<b> <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-07-13-update-historic-day-of-action-for-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">which drove</a> </b>millions of comments, emails and phone calls to decision makers, and saw broad participation from every corner of the Internet from major web platforms, startups, YouTubers, gamers, and forums like 4chan and reddit. The billboards will also mention lawmakers vote to gut Internet privacy rules that prevent ISPs from collecting and selling customer information to advertisers.</p><p>The <b><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#scoreboard" target="_blank">congressional scorecard</a> </b>divides Congress into two camps: Team Internet (those who are speaking up to defend net neutrality rules that protect online free speech) and Team Cable (those who are supporting the FCC’s plan to dismantle those protections and give Cable companies control over our online experience.) Lawmakers on “Team Cable” should expect to be targeted with billboards in the coming weeks if they do not speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan. </p><p>The announcements of both the billboards and scorecard come as all eyes shift to the Senate where Ajit Pai is expected to be confirmed as commissioner this week in a largely procedural vote. </p><p><b>Background on the historic July 12 net neutrality day of action: </b></p><p>Nearly all of the most popular websites on the web participated in a historic Internet-Wide <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/july12" target="_blank">Day of Action</a> to Save Net Neutrality on July 12, 2017 to oppose the FCC’s plan to slash Title II, the legal foundation for net neutrality rules that protect online free speech and innovation. A flood of web platforms small and large like Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Spotify, 4chan, Airbnb, Amazon, Mozilla, OK Cupid, Vimeo, Tinder, Expedia, Pornhub, Imgur, Yelp, Spotify, and Soundcloud &ndash; along with a vast array of online communities from every corner of the Internet: gaming forums, YouTube creators, subreddits and more &ndash; displayed prominent protest messages to their users, encouraging them to take action by contacting the FCC and Congress through tools like <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a> that make it easy for Internet users to make their voices heard. </p><p><b>See PHOTOS, IMAGES, and DESCRIPTIONS of how participants are protesting here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/vYVet" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/vYVet</a> </b></p><p><b>SEE A SAMPLING OF VIDEO COMMENTS here: <a href="https://vimeo.com/225341994/852009671a" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/225341994/852009671a</a></b> </p><p>There was so much activity on this day that organizers are still in the process of documenting and compiling it, but here are some initial numbers showing the scale of this massive event:</p><ul><li>Tens of millions of people saw the protest messages on participating websites</li><li>Over 5 million emails to Congress (which will be delivered over coming days)</li><li>More than 2 million comments to the FCC (nearly tripling our Sept. 10th 2014 “Internet Slowdown” record for most in a single day)</li><li>More than 125,000 phone calls to Congress</li><li>#NetNeutrality trended on both Facebook and Twitter</li><li>Protesters went in person to more than 20 Congressional offices </li><li>More than 125,000 websites, people, artists, online creators, and organizations signed up to participate in the initial call to protest</li><li>Celebrities flocked to support the effort including <a href="https://twitter.com/PearlJam/status/885230542576205824" target="_blank">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Wilco/status/885233478719221762" target="_blank">Wilco</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PearlJam/status/885230542576205824" target="_blank">Wil Wheaton</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimRobbins1/status/885154464432136192" target="_blank">Tim Robbins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SusanSarandon/status/885196657792516097" target="_blank">Susan Sarandon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blues_traveler/status/885242752656605184" target="_blank">Blues Traveler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenfry/status/884942083252920320" target="_blank">Steven Fry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/885098668910444544" target="_blank">Mark Ruffalo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraJaneGrace/status/885226732369960964" target="_blank">Laura Jane Grace</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kendrick38/status/885159414902042628" target="_blank">Kendrick Sampson</a>, <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/07/ted-leo-and-amanda-palmer-explain-why-we-need-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a>, <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/07/ted-leo-and-amanda-palmer-explain-why-we-need-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">Ted Leo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB/status/885257665924018176" target="_blank">Samantha Bee</a>, and many more.</li><li>Broad participation from every corner of the Internet: from online gaming communities to librarians to real estate sites to grassroots organizations to independent musicians. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/vYVet" target="_blank">See a gallery here.</a></li><li>Facebook, Google, and Dropbox three of the largest Internet companies, came out publicly with strong statements in support of the current FCC rules.

This is significant &ndash; especially given Facebook’s previous opposition to certain net neutrality rules, notably in India.</li></ul><p><b>Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, one of the leading groups behind the protest, issued the following statement (pronouns: she/hers): </b></p><p>“This was a historic moment when the Internet is realizing it’s power—with massive amounts of creative activism spreading to every corner of the Internet, from the smallest and weirdest nooks and crannies of the web to the most popular websites on earth. And this doesn’t end today—this protest is the kickoff of a sustained campaign to keep the pressure on lawmakers and the FCC to do the right thing. This is just our opening salvo, and it’s a massive one.</p><p>“The FCC needs to listen to the public, not just lobbyists from big cable companies. No one wants companies like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon to have control over what we can see and do online, or to have to pay them extra fees to access the content we want. The Internet is outraged by censorship and corruption, this is our moment to to defend net neutrality and fight for the future of freedom of expression.</p><p>“Lawmakers in Washington, DC need to understand that if they stand idly by and allow the FCC to gut these rules that are overwhelmingly supported by voters from across the political spectrum, they will be seen as enemies of the Internet and enemies of free speech.”</p><p><b>Pierce Stanley, technology fellow at Demand Progress, which co-led the effort: </b></p><p>“Today, the largest web platforms in the world, scrappy activist organizations, and individuals from across the political spectrum came together online and in-person to make their voices heard. </p><p>“Americans took to the internet to stand up for the rights to communicate freely, to organize, and to innovate online.  Ajit Pai’s plan to undermine net neutrality and stifle online speech would endanger these ways we use the internet, and could even make it harder &ndash; or impossible &ndash; to organize protests like today’s.</p><p>“Ajit Pai may think big cable’s interests are more important than the public’s, but today’s activism makes it clear that few outside the boardrooms of Comcast or AT&amp;T agree. A large majority of Americans of all political persuasions support net neutrality, and their voices were heard loud and clear. Today was the first step in taking back the internet from Pai and his cable cabal.”</p><p><b>Candace Clement, campaign director for Free Press Action Fund, which co-led the effort:<br/></b></p><p>“People used the internet to save the internet today. That’s because the Trump FCC’s push to ​destroy​ ​Net Neutrality's​ ​legal foundation​ ​isn&rsquo;t fooling anyone​. <br/><br/>“We know that the open internet is critical for marginalized communities that ​​corporate media have misrepresented; that it’s essential for free speech and political organizing online; and that tech entrepreneurs need an open network to survive just as much as working families​ do​. <br/><br/>“Today we all joined together to stop FCC Chairman Pai’s quest to destroy the Net Neutrality safeguards that are ​crucial​ to everyone’s right to connect and communicate. And we’re going to stick with this fight for as long as it takes to preserve the open internet protections the majority of Americans demand.”<br/></p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice which co-led the effort, said:<br/></b></p><p>“Today, thousands of people of color and civil rights leaders raised our voices to say loud and clear: we won&rsquo;t let our internet become like cable TV, a white, middle class, and male bastion where we are shouted down daily. We&rsquo;ll keep joining with allies of all kinds across the lines of difference to fight for our digital voice, and ensure that an open Internet protected by Title II net neutrality delivers political power and economic opportunity for those long excluded from both.

And this doesn’t end today—this protest is the kickoff of a sustained campaign to keep the pressure on lawmakers and the FCC to do the right thing. This is just our opening salvo, and it’s a massive one.</p><p>“The FCC needs to listen to the public, not just lobbyists from big cable companies. No one wants companies like Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon to have control over what we can see and do online, or to have to pay them extra fees to access the content we want. The Internet is outraged by censorship and corruption, this is our moment to to defend net neutrality and fight for the future of freedom of expression.</p><p>“Lawmakers in Washington, DC need to understand that if they stand idly by and allow the FCC to gut these rules that are overwhelmingly supported by voters from across the political spectrum, they will be seen as enemies of the Internet and enemies of free speech.”</p><p><b>Pierce Stanley, technology fellow at Demand Progress, which co-led the effort: </b></p><p>“Today, the largest web platforms in the world, scrappy activist organizations, and individuals from across the political spectrum came together online and in-person to make their voices heard. </p><p>“Americans took to the internet to stand up for the rights to communicate freely, to organize, and to innovate online.  Ajit Pai’s plan to undermine net neutrality and stifle online speech would endanger these ways we use the internet, and could even make it harder &ndash; or impossible &ndash; to organize protests like today’s.</p><p>“Ajit Pai may think big cable’s interests are more important than the public’s, but today’s activism makes it clear that few outside the boardrooms of Comcast or AT&amp;T agree. A large majority of Americans of all political persuasions support net neutrality, and their voices were heard loud and clear. Today was the first step in taking back the internet from Pai and his cable cabal.”</p><p><b>Candace Clement, campaign director for Free Press Action Fund, which co-led the effort:</b><br/></p><p>“People used the internet to save the internet today. That’s because the Trump FCC’s push to ​destroy​ ​Net Neutrality's​ ​legal foundation​ ​isn&rsquo;t fooling anyone​. <br/><br/>“We know that the open internet is critical for marginalized communities that ​​corporate media have misrepresented; that it’s essential for free speech and political organizing online; and that tech entrepreneurs need an open network to survive just as much as working families​ do​. <br/><br/>“Today we all joined together to stop FCC Chairman Pai’s quest to destroy the Net Neutrality safeguards that are ​crucial​ to everyone’s right to connect and communicate. And we’re going to stick with this fight for as long as long as it takes to preserve the open internet protections the majority of Americans demand.”<br/></p><p><b>Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice which co-led the effort, said:</b></p><p>“Today, thousands of people of color and civil rights leaders raised our voices to say loud and clear: we won&rsquo;t let our internet become like cable TV, a white, middle class, and male bastion where we are shouted down daily. We&rsquo;ll keep joining with allies of all kinds across the lines of difference to fight for our digital voice, and ensure that an open Internet protected by Title II net neutrality delivers political power and economic opportunity for those long excluded from both. The stakes are too high to do anything less.”</p><p>The effort is led by many of the grassroots groups behind the largest online protests in history including the SOPA blackout and the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a>.
