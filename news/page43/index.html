        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="1064"><img data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="1064" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nopm0k9gfL1s45cnp_540.png?1512060080111"/></figure><p>We’re so close to making the government get a legit warrant before they can monitor and track us. <b>For all the people who have ever wanted to see or worked towards the end of the Patriot Act over the past dozen years, this is our moment. </b><br/></p><p>If Congress does nothing—something they are very good at—the NSA’s mass phone data collection will <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/obama-admin-nsa-spying-will-begin-shutting-down-this-week-20150520" target="_blank">begin shutting down on Friday.</a> And on midnight of Monday, June 1, 2015, the section of the Patriot Act that has been used (illegally) to justify mass surveillance will sunset and no longer be U.S. law. </p><p>Holy shit. <br/></p><p><b><a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#protest" target="_blank">If you want the Patriot Act to die a quick and painless death (and even if you secretly want it to struggle and suffer, alone and afraid) Join us THIS EVENING at one of our 50+ nationwide Sunset the Patriot Act vigils. </a></b><br/></p><p>Here’s why we have such a golden opportunity right now.<br/></p><p>Because of Rand Paul’s filibuster of the Senate yesterday, things have been pushed back so that a vote on limiting debate on whether or not to begin debate of reauthorization of the Patriot Act (either straight up or under the Orwellian “<a href="http://usafreedom.fail/" target="_blank">USA Freedom Act</a>”) won’t happen until Saturday, after the NSA begins winding down its collection program. These motions on the reauthorization bills will require 60 votes to be approved, and that seems unlikely at this point. If they do somehow get 60 votes, a final vote won’t happen until Wednesday of next week. </p><p>But here’s the thing. All bills have to go through both the Senate and the House of Representatives before they can become law, and the House is leaving for vacation today until after the Patriot Act section expires. The House has already <a href="https://medium.com/@donnydonny/follow-the-money-usa-freedom-act-backers-in-congress-have-taken-more-than-twice-as-much-money-8e1f59d6be61" target="_blank">passed the USA Freedom Act</a>, which renews the Patriot Act, so the only real way for Congress to stop a sunset at this point is for the Senate to pass that bill. </p><p>Our <a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#congress" target="_blank">vote count</a> shows that the Senate doesn’t have the votes to pass it, so if we can prevent a few on-the-fence Senators from siding with the NSA on this, we will be going back to a world where law enforcement and Intelligence officials need to actually get a warrant to spy on us. </p><p>At that point, if Congress wants to bring back the ability for the government to spy on us without a warrant they will need to affirmatively re-legislate the PATRIOT Act. It won’t be just a matter of extending sunset dates anymore. Every member of Congress will have to go down on the record saying they don’t want the government to have to seek a warrant to spy on us, which is a very unpopular position and something that <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/09/64_percent_of_911_legislators.php" target="_blank">2/3rds</a> of the House of Representatives have never had to vote on. </p><p>We are so close to an epic win on mass surveillance. That’s why we’re hosting sunset vigils across the country this evening at senators’ local offices to call on the Patriot Act to expire. <br/></p><p>If you want this win; If you want the government to have to get a warrant before they can spy on you, your communications, and your family, Join us tonight. </p><p><b><a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#protest" target="_blank">Find a local Sunset the Patriot Act vigil here. </a></b></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-05-20-release-hundreds-of-tech-companies-to/">RELEASE: Hundreds of Tech Companies to Congress: TPP and Fast Track Harms Digital Innovation and Users’ Rights</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:43 EDT on May 20, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 20, 2015</p><p>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer<br/>Campaign Director, Fight For the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457, Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Maira Sutton<br/>Global Policy Analyst, Electronic Frontier Foundation<br/>Phone: (415) 436 - 9333 x175, Email:  maira@eff.org<br/><br/>In <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and" target="_blank">a joint letter</a> t</b>o Congress released today, more than 250 technology companies and user rights organizations say that the extreme level of secrecy surrounding trade negotiations have led to provisions in agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that threaten digital innovation, free speech, and access to knowledge online, and the letter calls on Congress to come out against the Fast Track (AKA Trade Promotion Authority [TPA]) bill for legitimizing this secretive process. Its signatories include AVG Technologies, DreamHost, Namecheap, Mediafire, Imgur, Internet Archive, BoingBoing, Piwik, Private Internet Access, and many others.<br/></p><p>The letter specifically identifies the TPP&rsquo;s threats based on leaked texts of the agreement—how it threatens fair use, could lead to more costly forms of online copyright enforcement, criminalize whistleblowing and investigative journalism, and create investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) courts that would further jeopardize user protections in domestic laws. The Fast Track bill, the companies write, would legitimize the exclusive process that has led to these and other provisions, as well as undermine lawmakers&rsquo; efforts towards striking the right balance between the interests of copyright holders and those of innovators and users.</p><p>“We simply cannot allow our policymakers to use secret trade negotiations to make digital policy for the 21st century,” <b>said Maira Sutton, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </b>“Leaks of the TPP agreement have revealed time and time again that this opaque process has led to provisions that undermine our rights to free speech, privacy, and innovation online. The TPP is a huge threat to the Internet and its users. Full stop.”</p><p>“The future of the Internet is simply too important to be decided behind closed doors,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.</b> “The Fast Track / Trade Promotion Authority process actively silences the voices of Internet users, startups, and small tech companies while giving the biggest players even more power to set policy that benefits a few select companies while undermining the health of the entire Web.”</p><p><b>Harvey Anderson, Chief Legal Officer of the popular anti-virus software company AVG Technologies: </b>&ldquo;The current administration has done much to promote openness and transparency as governance principles and in managing Internet policy, they can, and we expect, that they can do much better than the current Fast Track bill.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Carl Wilcox, CEO of nanotech firm Advanced Surfaces and Processes, Inc.: </b>“Technology companies like us, especially startups and emerging companies, need a level business playing field, not one where mega corporations make the rules and can sue them in a mega-corporation court whose judges and attorneys are all employed by mega-corporations. TPP impacts us negatively when they dictate intellectual property, food safety, the price of prescription drugs, weak environmental, buy local and labor safety rules.”</p><p><b>David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at Basecamp and creator of the popular Ruby on Rails web development framework: </b> “TPP makes a mockery of democratic legislative ideals. It&rsquo;s shrouded in secrecy exactly because it would wither in sunlight. It&rsquo;s a terrible piece of overreach to endow a few special interests with enormous and unsavory power. The whole thing needs to be scrapped and started over. International trade is too important to have it hitched to this collection of wishful thinking by a select few.</p><p><b>Cory Doctorow, author, journalist, and co-editor of Boing Boing: </b>&ldquo;Democracies make their laws in public, not in smoke-filled rooms. If TPP&rsquo;s backers truly believed that they were doing the people&rsquo;s work, they&rsquo;d have invited the people into the room. The fact that they went to extreme, unprecedented measures to stop anyone from finding out what was going on—even going so far as to threaten Congress with jail if they spoke about it —tells you that this is something being done *to* Americans, not *for* Americans.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Founder of the Copia Institute, Mike Masnick: </b>“In the last two decades the Internet has been one of the main drivers of economic growth, progress and prosperity worldwide. And, yet, leaked portions of the TPP agreement and the current fast track bill shows that no one is even considering the impact on the digital economy and digital rights. The TPP and TPA are not designed for an Internet era, or even taking the Internet economy into account. That the whole thing has been written in secret only makes this more concerning over the impact it will have on the most dynamic and important sectors of the economy today.”</p><p><b>For the full letter, visit: <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and</a></b> </p><p>###</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-05-20-hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and/">Hundreds of Tech Companies to Congress: TPP and Fast Track Harms Digital Innovation and Users’ Rights</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:07 EDT on May 20, 2015</span>


        <p><i>The following letter was sent to Congress on May 20th by more than 250 technology companies and users’ rights organizations. <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119441457328/release-hundreds-of-tech-companies-to" target="_blank">See the press release here.</a></b> You can see the letter as a PDF </i><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/tech-company-and-user-groups-letter-congress-urging-their-opposition-tpp-fast-track" target="_blank"><b><i>here.</i></b> </a><br/><br/><b>Dear Members of Congress,</b><br/></p><p>We write to you as a community representing thousands of our nation&rsquo;s innovators, entrepreneurs, job-creators, and users to express our concern over trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Despite containing many provisions that go far beyond the scope of traditional trade policy, the public is kept in the dark as these deals continue to be negotiated behind closed doors with heavy influence from only a limited subset of stakeholders.</p><p>The recently-introduced Fast Track bill (the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, “the Bill”) would not remedy the utter lack of transparency of the negotiation process, nor does it include any language to ensure that these deals would contain safeguards to protect our interests in freedom of expression and innovation online. These are just some of our specific concerns we have: </p><p>*    Threats to Fair Use: The TPP contains language that could prevent countries from expanding exceptions and limitations to copyright. The Fast Track Bill also contains nothing to promote balance in copyright law. This is despite how much value fair use has added to the U.S. economy and could add for investors in the growing economies of our trading partners.</p><p>*    Expensive and Harmful Costs of Online Enforcement: U.S. law incentivizes online content providers to take down content over a mere allegation of infringement. The TPP will likely emulate these rules, continuing to make it expensive and onerous for startups and small companies to oversee users’ activities and process each takedown notice.</p><p>*    Criminalizing Journalism and Whistleblowing: TPP’s trade secrets provisions could make it a crime for people to reveal corporate wrongdoing &ldquo;through a computer system.” The language is dangerously vague, and enables signatory countries to enact rules that would ban reporting on timely, critical issues affecting the public.</p><p>*   Investor-State Courts Jeopardize User Protections: The TPP Investment Chapter contains text that would enable corporations to sue nations over democratic rules that allegedly harm expected future profits. Companies can use this process to undermine U.S. rules like fair use, net neutrality, and others designed to protect the free, open Internet and users&rsquo; rights to free expression online.</p><p>Overall, the Bill would legitimize the secret process that has led to these provisions, while doing nothing to ensure that these agreements would enable lawmakers to work towards striking the right balance between the interests of copyright holders and those of users and innovators. As such, we urge you to come out against the Fast Track bill and call on your colleagues in Congress to do the same.</p><p><b>Sincerely,</b></p><p>2b1Inc<br/>ACN Telecommunications &amp; Energy<br/>Adafruit Industries<br/>Advanced Surfaces and Processes Inc.<br/>Airborne Surfer Media<br/>Aldine Publications, LLC <br/>Alpine Travel Services<br/>Archer Law Offices PC<br/>art-efex.com<br/>ArtsDigital.co<br/>Astonishing Legends Productions, LLC<br/>Atlantistechs<br/>Automation Technology, Inc.<br/>Autopia, Ltd<br/>AVG Technologies<br/>Babel Consulting, Inc.<br/>BAGeL Radio<br/>Basecamp<br/>Baumhauerphoto.com<br/>Bay Buys, LLC<br/>Bead &amp; Reel<br/>Bilerico Media LLC<br/>Black Hills Computer Consulting, Inc.<br/>Blue Dog Mobile Marketing<br/>Blue Gothic Design Studios, LLC<br/>BlueTree Website Design<br/>Bohemian Jedi<br/>Boing Boing<br/>Breakwind Farm<br/>Butterflies &amp; Blueberries, Inc<br/>Catalysta LLC<br/>Cell Nation, Inc.<br/>Centerlyne<br/>Cheezburger Network<br/>Chocolate Pocket, LLC<br/>Civic Hall<br/>CoachAccountable, LLC<br/>Codecooler.com<br/>Collaborative Design and Planning<br/>Comatose Podcast<br/>Computer Fix-It<br/>ComputerGiant Consulting, Inc.<br/>Concentric Sky, Inc.<br/>Connect Everywhere LLC<br/>CONTEMPL8 T-SHIRTS LLC<br/>Copia Institute<br/>crasstalk.com<br/>Create Your Health, LLC<br/>CREDO Mobile<br/>CTVotersCount.org<br/>Cultural Circle Poetry Workshops<br/>Curren Media Group<br/>Deskninja Studios LLC<br/>Disconnect<br/>DJs Computers<br/>Dobson Computer Svcs<br/>DreamHost<br/>Duct Tape Programming<br/>eCnet Solutions<br/>Eden Foods<br/>Edison Cimputers, Inc.<br/>Electronic Frontier Foundation<br/>Ellicottville Real Estate<br/>Engineered Fear, LLC<br/>Eric A.
