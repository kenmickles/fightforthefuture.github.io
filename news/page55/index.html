        <span class="date">Posted 15:58 EST on December 10, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank"><span><strong><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ngdwx83baN1ri3xd7.jpg?1512060080725"/></strong></span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank"><span><strong>The FCC is stalling. They’re meeting on Thursday and somehow net neutrality is not on the agenda. Join us December 11th for a morning of protest at the FCC.</strong> </span><span><br/></span></a><span><br/>Hi Friend,<br/><br/></span><span>FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has delayed a vote on Net Neutrality until 2015 — and he’s probably hoping the public scrutiny will fade by then.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Guess what: It won&rsquo;t. And to make sure he knows it, we&rsquo;re showing up in person at the agency&rsquo;s final meeting of the year to remind Wheeler that we&rsquo;re #StillWatching him and will keep making noise until the FCC protects the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank">We need you there next Thursday:</a></strong><span> All you need to do is grab some props (like oversized specs or a magnifying glass) and show up to join in the fun.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the details:</span></p>
<p><strong>What:</strong><span> Rally to Save the Internet: Net Neutrality Now</span></p>
<p><strong>When:</strong><span> Thurs., Dec. 11, 9–10 a.m.</span></p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong><span> Outside FCC headquarters, 445 12th St. SW, Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><strong>RSVP: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank"><span>Click here to tell us you&rsquo;re coming and invite your friends.</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Bring:</strong><span> A magnifying glass/specs and a sign calling for Title II, your cell phone, tablet, or laptop with </span><a href="http://protestsign.org" target="_blank"><span>ProtestSign.org</span></a><span> loaded!</span></p>
<p><span>At 10am toward the end of the rally, meet at the back of the protest on the sidewalk on 12th street with other net neutrality supporters who will be going inside the meeting and holding their phones silently in protest. Follow </span><a href="http://twitter.com/fightfortheftr" target="_blank"><strong>@fightfortheftr</strong></a><span> on the day of for updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Wheeler claims he needs more time to mull over Net Neutrality— but you and I both know that he has all the info he needs right now to reclassify Internet-access service under Title II. And there should be no doubt in his mind that reclassifying under Title II is the </span><span>only</span><span> way to protect the open Internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/892510804107148/" target="_blank">Join us on Dec. 11 to demand Net Neutrality now—</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Please RSVP if you can make it, and if not, please invite any friends you have in the area!</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all you do,<br/>-Evan at FFTF</span></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-12-03-press-release-net-neutrality-activists-give-the/">PRESS RELEASE: Net neutrality activists give the FCC a holiday break</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:48 EST on December 3, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ng0iu0e5091ri3xd7.png?1512060080725"/></span></a></p>
<p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>December 3, 2014<br/><br/>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org</span><span><br/><br/><strong>Net neutrality activists give FCC a holiday break, for one week they will stop driving thousands of phone calls</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Fight for the Future and other groups have driven more than 55,000 phone calls to desks at the FCC in the last two months, keeping phones at the agency ringing off the hook with voices for Title II</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON &ndash; Today, net neutrality activists announced that, in the spirit of the holidays, they will be giving the FCC a one-week break from constant phone calls in support of Title II net neutrality. Internet freedom groups have bombarded 30 top officials at the agency with tens of thousands of phone calls since late September, when it appeared that FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler was preparing to ignore nearly 4 million public comments on the issue.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>To date, the page </span><strong><a href="http://callthefcc.com" target="_blank">CallTheFCC.com</a></strong><span> has connected more than 55,000 phone calls to FCC staffers–nearly 1,000 every day for the last two months. More than 1,800 people have signed up to be “daily callers,” meaning they receive a reminder to call a new FCC official each day. Calls skip the FCC switchboard and go directly to the desks of 30 top officials.. FCC officials have told activists via email that their phones are ringing off the hook every hour of the business day.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>This morning, Fight for the Future emailed the 30 FCC employees who have been receiving calls to inform them that they’d be stopping the calls for one week, but that they should expect even more pressure after the FCC meets December 11th – if the FCC does not show clear signs it is moving quickly toward a vote on Title II net neutrality rules in January.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The statement below can be attributed to Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng:</strong><br/></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The FCC should be accountable to the public, not the special interests of a select few companies. We know that monopolies like Comcast and Verizon spend tens of millions of dollars lobbying and are constantly calling and visiting the FCC to make sure that their position is heard. We built CallTheFCC.com to make sure that the public has the same opportunity.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>In the last few months, we’ve surrounded the FCC with protests and bombarded them with phone calls. </span><strong>Today, in the holiday spirit, we’ll be stopping the phone calls for one week</strong><span><strong>.</strong> We are giving the FCC the benefit of the doubt that they are finally listening to the overwhelming public consensus, and are moving toward a vote on strong Title II net neutrality rules in January. December 11th is FCC’s next meeting, and we will be there in force. If we don’t hear Chairman Wheeler make a strong statement indicating that his agency is listening to the public and moving toward Title II rules, we’ll redouble our calling efforts starting on December 12th, and unveil a new tool that makes it even easier for the public to make their voices heard at the FFC.<br/></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>CallTheFCC.com was built by Fight for the Future, and has been supported by Demand Progress, reddit, Free Press, MoveOn, CREDO Action, Democracy for America, and other netroots organizations.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future were lead organizers of the </span><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank"><span>Internet Slowdown</span></a><span> on September 10th, which mobilized 40,000 websites in support of Title II net neutrality, and drove more than 750,000 FCC comments and 300,000 phone calls in a single day. They were also instrumental in organizing the </span><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>Occupy the FCC</span></a><span> encampment, which helped bring Title II into the national spotlight, and put it on the table as an option at the FCC.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>“There are so many people who want to speak out on net neutrality, that it’s amazing what happens when you give them an easy way to do it,” </span><strong>said Fight for the Future’s Chief Technical Officer Jeff Lyon,</strong><span><strong> who built CallTheFCC.com,</strong> “We know the people at the FCC are people too, so we’re happy to give them a week off. Hundreds of calls a day is a lot to handle. But they need to do the right thing and stop delaying the process in ways that benefit Cable companies and hurts the public. If the FCC </span><span>does</span><span> move forward with a strong net neutrality rule, we can direct all this attention to defending the FCC’s decision in Congress. There are millions of people ready to fight for net neutrality, the FCC’s choice is whether to side with those millions or go it alone.”</span><span><br/></span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 13:54 EST on December 2, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nfyxvaNmLD1ri3xd7.png?1512060080725"/></span></a></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-186a4ad0-0737-2a73-6049-b13d980a2b44"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">Urgent: vote coming soon on the TPP Internet censorship plan. Click here to speak out.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The U.S. Trade Representative has confirmed that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is moving again, with  confidential meetings in Washington, DC next week. TPP-defenders in Congress have already been making noise about a Fast Track vote, and this could be a sign that it’s coming soon. </span></p>
<p><span>Just last month, the latest version of the TPP’s crucial copyright &amp; intellectual property chapter was leaked, and the news was not good. </span><span>The Internet censorship provisions in the </span><span>TPP have gotten even worse. </span><span>[1]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">Don’t let governments censor the net. Take action now to stop Fast Track for the TPP.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’ve beaten the TPP back before. It’s time to do it again. While these secret meetings are being pushed by the White House, corrupt officials in Congress want to “fast track” the TPP right now during the lame duck session. [2] The vote could be close. Will you take action now to stop Internet censorship?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.stopfasttrack.com/" target="_blank">Click here to stop the TPP Internet censorship plan.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Millions of people have already spoken out against the TPP power grab. Every issue we care about depends on the future of the free and open web. Take a moment today to defend it.</span></p>

This year’s event is the third annual event. The first year, 60 merchants participated, helping gain much needed attention and legitimacy for Bitcoin.

<p><span>“We’re really excited for this year’s event because it has all the opportunity to be much bigger than last year’s event” says Jon Holmquist, the founder of Bitcoin Friday, ”Even though the Bitcoin prices might be lower than last year, the quantity and caliber of merchants participating this year has improved greatly. Consumers should be able to do most, if not all, of their holiday shopping with Bitcoin this year.”</span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin Black Friday is backed by a solid circle of Bitcoin believers. It would not have been possible without community support. It is also sponsored by several merchants as well BitPay and Circle.</span></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-ff04dea0-e89e-e05b-4f75-83b6db0bea30"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>Our country’s spy agencies think they’re above the law. Now, we’ve got a unique chance to leak their dirtiest secrets and hold them accountable. Best of all, it’s perfectly legal.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://releasethetorturereport.com/?code=FFTF" target="_blank">Click here to ask Senator Mark Udall to read the CIA Torture Report into the Congressional record.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Here’s the story: the Bush-era CIA tortured people. Horrifically, and illegally. The Senate Intelligence committee investigated (getting spied on by the CIA in the process!) and wants to make the report public. But the CIA and the White House are blocking its release. </span></p>
<p><span>One Senator on the committee, Mark Udall, lost his reelection bid this year and won’t be returning to the Senate. </span><span>That’s our loophole: since Udall has nothing to lose, and because members of Congress are immune for anything said in the Congressional record, </span><span>Udall can leak the report without breaking any law.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://releasethetorturereport.com/?code=FFTF" target="_blank">But he needs our encouragement: tell Senator Mark Udall to read the CIA Torture Report into the Congressional record</a>.</strong></p>
<p><span>The public deserves to know what the government has been doing in our name. Here’s our chance to drag one of the government’s biggest secrets into the light. Let’s do this and stop runaway spy agencies like the CIA from thinking they can operate above the law.<br/><br/></span><span>Sincerely,<br/>Kevin and Evan at Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. We know many people are focused today on the events unfolding in Ferguson. We’ve written to you </span><strong><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/95307642018/heres-how-we-get-our-democracy-back-after" target="_blank">before</a></strong><span> with our thoughts. We fight for free speech online and off. If you feel called to protest, </span><strong><a href="http://fergusonresponse.tumblr.com" target="_blank">here’s a list of nationwide demonstrations</a></strong><span> (not maintained by FFTF). Stay safe. Justice doesn’t always come quickly, but it will come.</span></p>
